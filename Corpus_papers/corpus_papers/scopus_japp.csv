Simultaneously, the transition to IFRS 9 created the need for higher provisioning and for weighting sale scenarios in the assessment of NPLs. This study, using a scenario analysis based on the Italian experience of the NPL resolution process, focuses on the cost of deleveraging by comparing the alternative strategies of direct sale and securitization. The study highlights the impact of the assumptions derived from the portfolio assessment and the additional cost arising from the uncertainties surrounding the appropriate recovery procedure. It demonstrates that securitization minimises this cost, while estimating the benefit derived from the support of State-backed guarantees. These findings provide useful insights for policy makers, suggesting the promotion of further measures that aim to reduce the transfer of value from banks to third parties. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Cost of deleveraging; IFRS 9; Non-performing loans; Securitization; Strategic management",,"Bolognesi, E.; University of Udine, Via Tomadini 30, Italy; email: enrica.bolognesi@uniud.it",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

Using the difference-in-difference approach, we first find significantly higher CEO turnover following hedge fund activism. After we split target companies into the CEO-turnover and non-CEO-turnover sub-samples, we find that only new CEOs in targeted companies get more compensation following hedge fund activism while incumbent CEO pay does not significantly change. The relationship between CEO bonuses and return on assets following hedge fund activism also differs across the subsamples split by CEO turnover. Pay-performance relationship is enhanced by hedge fund activism for new CEOs, but not for incumbent CEOs. In additional analyses, we document that CEO turnover is positively associated with Tobin's Q and shareholder votes on Say on Pay in target companies after hedge fund activism. © 2020",,,"Choi, W.; Department of Accounting, United States; email: wchoi@fullerton.edu",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

The findings reveal that firms in provinces with more cultural embeddedness on cigarette packages exhibit significantly higher extent of discretionary accruals. This finding suggests that cultural embeddedness on cigarette packages as a tobacco-related sinful behavior window dressing shapes unethical social atmosphere, elicits unethical managerial behavior, brings out information distortion, and eventually reduces financial reporting quality. Moreover, the positive relation between cultural embeddedness on cigarette packages and discretionary accruals is less pronounced for firms with foreign directors than for their counterparts. Furthermore, our findings are robust to a variety of sensitivity tests using alternative proxies for cultural embeddedness on cigarette packages and financial reporting quality, and further our conclusions still stand after employing the difference-in-difference approach, two-stage least square regression procedure and two-stage Heckman method to address the endogeneity problem.

We first illustrate how the magnitude of residuals from the accruals model can vary significantly by industry, thus highlighting the importance of including industry fixed effects when the dependent variable is discretionary accruals. We next replicate GU's findings. We first attempt to replicate prior literature after including industry fixed effects in the audit quality (discretionary accruals) models. This is an important control, as the relevant benchmark for a firm with an industry specialist auditor is a peer firm in the same industry with a non-specialist auditor. We find that after including industry fixed effects, there is no association between seasoned industry specialist auditors and discretionary accruals. We also find that the association between industry specialization and discretionary accruals is very sensitive to the way in which the researcher calculates specialization. Our findings are informative for shareholders of public companies who vote on auditor ratification. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Accruals models; Audit quality; Industry effects; Industry specialization",,"Eshleman, J.D.; Rutgers, United States; email: dan.eshleman@rutgers.edu",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

We exploit the regional variations generated by the implementation in 2013 of the third stage of the China Tax Administration Information System (CTAIS-3) pilot. The CTAIS-3 is a nationally unified information system that significantly reduces information asymmetry between different tax authorities across regions. We find that the CTAIS-3 pilot significantly reduced firms’ conforming and non-conforming tax avoidance. The enhanced tax enforcement is particularly prominent if a firm is of a smaller size, or is administrated by the State Administration of Taxation, or is a non-state-owned enterprises, or locates in cities with a higher level of local fiscal pressure. Furthermore, we show that the CTAIS-3 improved the CIT enforcement by deterring firms from underreporting accounts receivable, as well as over-reporting accounts payable, inventory and the number of employees. In general, it would be more difficult for firms to hide profits from tax authorities under the CTAIS-3. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","China tax administration information system; Corporate income tax; Information; Tax enforcement",,"Shao, Y.; School of Economics, China; email: shaoych04@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

It draws on the literature and the case of two UK school PPP contracts with varying degree of trust among the partners to illustrate the role of control in building competence trust and goodwill trust, and how trust in turn affects control. Prior to entering into the PPP contract, under a condition of high risk and low trust, reliance was placed on formal control to evaluate competence trust for the purpose of selecting a preferred bidder, whilst goodwill trust, which takes time to evolve, played no role in the selection process. During contract implementation, formal control formed the basis for demonstrating competence and nurturing goodwill trust. Trust subsequently determined the extent of reliance on formal control and informal control. In the case of School 1, high level of trust led to a reliance on informal control which enabled partners to focus resources on solving problems, whilst formal control operated in the background. In the case of School 2, low level of trust and perceived lack of transparency led to a demand for additional formal control. This study adds to the trust-control literature by shedding light on how trust relates to control, in the context of long-term PPP contracts which are difficult to specify in advance. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Alliances; Control; Partnerships; Performance; PPPs; Trust",,"Khadaroo, I.; Accounting and Finance Department, P.O.

These results hold in a difference-in-difference research design with firm and year fixed effects or using matched nonadopting firms as controls, as well as a regression discontinuity design. The impact of XBRL adoption on reducing local bias can be explained by three economic channels: decreased information processing costs, increased corporate disclosures, and improved analyst coverage. We further find that institutions’ superior stock returns in geographic proximate equity investments significantly reduces after the XBRL mandate. The observed reduction in institutional investors’ local bias within U.S. companies following the XBRL mandate also applies to the international setting.

Our analyses are set in the German environment, where firms may choose to “downlist” from an EU-regulated to an exchange-regulated stock market, thereby circumvent mandatory preparation of IFRS financial statements and enforcement oversight. We find that downlisting firms are more likely to have been censured by enforcement bodies for erroneous accounting, compared to a sample of control firms, and that this association is more pronounced for severe or controversial errors. This finding is consistent with enforcement actions creating costs for firms and managers. Event study analyses show that market price reactions to firms’ downlisting announcements are negative in about one out of two cases. This suggests that in quite a few cases, managers, by downlisting, may be protecting private benefits rather than the interests of equity holders. Additional analyses reveals that about half of our sample firms continued to prepare IFRS financial statements on a voluntary basis after the downlisting. Taken together, our results contribute to the literature on the economic consequences of the EU's IAS and enforcement regulation by suggesting that some firms adopt avoidance strategies to opt out of enforcement supervision. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Hitz, J.-M.; Georg-August-UniversityGermany; email: hitz@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

I use this change to examine the association between equity values and financial statement data in voluntary and mandatory disclosure environments. Before the change, disclosure of financial statement information was voluntary for most of these firms. I study firms that initiate SEC filing after the change and classify them as disclosing and nondisclosing based on whether they voluntarily disclosed financial statement information before the regulatory change. In these firms’ initial SEC filings after the eligibility rule, they retroactively disclose financial statement information for the year prior to compliance with the rule. Thus I can observe previously withheld financial data. I find that the choice to voluntarily disclose is negatively associated with firm characteristics related to proprietary costs and with situations in which accounting information plays a less important role in resolving information asymmetry. For nondisclosing firms, I find evidence that equity values reflect financial statement data, even though this information was not publicly available, and that compliance with mandatory SEC disclosure requirements strengthens this association.

The SEC has made repeated calls for the disclosure of foreign cash in order for investors to have more information in determining firms’ liquidity positions. We examine the association between firm value and the non-disclosure of foreign cash in industries where the majority of firms choose to disclose foreign cash. We define partial disclosure as disclosing permanently reinvested earnings (PRE), but withholding the disclosure of foreign cash, and find that when the majority of industry peers disclose foreign cash, investors discount the firm-specific partial disclosure of foreign operations. This finding suggests that investors have similar information demands as the SEC, and that withholding foreign cash results in a valuation discount. We also find that this discount is more pronounced for firms predicted to have higher levels of foreign cash and higher levels of PRE. The discount in firm value is also concentrated among firms with managers who have more career concerns, suggesting that managers shift the cost of partial disclosure to shareholders instead of bearing the personal reputational cost of full disclosure. Our results are robust to multiple matched samples and entropy balancing. While previous literature has considered the valuation implications of foreign cash disclosures, we reveal the consequences of opting to withhold the disclosure of foreign cash. Our findings should be of interest to both managers and policy-setters in forming their disclosure protocols. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Foreign cash disclosure; Industry financial reporting norms; Peer effects",,"Downes, J.F.445H College of Business, P.O.

We examine whether firms’ ex ante needs for accounting discretion affect their decisions to adopt fair value reporting for investment property and the ex post performance management by these fair value adopters. Our findings show that the voluntary adoption of fair value reporting for investment property in China remains low. However, the fair value option for investment property is significantly more likely to be chosen by firms with greater needs for accounting discretion. Consistent with the conjecture that firms choose the fair value model to manipulate reported earnings, we show that fair value adopters use the unrealized gains and losses associated with investment properties to smooth earnings and that these firms are also more likely to meet or beat earnings benchmarks after adoption.

Based on the costs and benefits of using EM to hide negative information, we derive an analytical model showing that there are two possibilities: (1) a firm engages in less accrual-based and real EM when facing short-seller scrutiny (the informational efficiency hypothesis), or (2) a firm switches from accrual-based EM (a less sophisticated method) to real EM (a more sophisticated method), which we call the sophisticated information-hiding hypothesis. That is, there is a tradeoff between accrual-based and real EM in the presence of short sales. Using a natural experiment of the recent short sales deregulation in China, we show findings consistent with the latter reaction. Additional analysis suggests that the decrease in accrual-based EM and increase in real EM are driven primarily by firms with non-Big 10 auditors or firms not under shareholder or regulatory scrutiny. We interpret the findings as being consistent with the model prediction that for firms with weak inside and outside monitoring, the probability of detecting real EM is low, and thus the tradeoff between accrual-based and real EM prevails in the presence of short sales. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Accrual-based earnings management; Negative information hiding; Real earnings management; Short sales",,"He, J.; School of Accounting, China; email: he.jie@zuel.edu.cn",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

We first document a positive association between conditional conservatism and firms’ access to trade credit both before and after the onset of the crisis, which indicates suppliers’ demand for conditional conservatism. Meanwhile, the association between conditional conservatism and trade credit experienced a significant decline following the onset of the crisis, and this only held when suppliers and customers had frequent transactions or were in close proximity, when transacted goods were standardized rather than differentiated, when customers were financially constrained and had high bargaining power, and when suppliers had sufficient liquidity. It implies that, when information asymmetry along the supply chain was low and customers had strong bargaining power, liquid suppliers increased their tolerance to less conservative customers, and they were even willing to grant trade credit to the less conservative customers that were financially constrained.

The uncertainty related to the enforcement of federal cannabis laws affects businesses located in legalizing states, particularly federally-insured banks. Applying a difference-in-differences approach to a matched sample of banks in legalizing and non-legalizing states, we document an increase in audit fees incurred by banks located in legalizing states after cannabis legalization. This finding is consistent with increased auditor effort and engagement risk being an unintended consequence of state-level recreational cannabis legalization.

This study examines whether and how the severity of media coverage of a firm's negative ESG issues (tainted ESG reputation) is associated with audit effort and audit quality. I find that auditors manage the higher expected engagement risk conveyed by tainted ESG reputation by applying higher audit effort. Next, I observe that the increased effort is associated with auditors likely detecting and requiring adjustments for material misstatements and that tainted ESG reputation is associated with fewer misstatements (i.e., reduces poor audit quality). The association between tainted ESG reputation and audit quality is driven primarily by increased audit report lag, not by increased audit fees. Further, I find that tainted ESG reputation is positively associated with audit effort and reduces poor audit quality for up to three years.

In the most adverse scenario, the average firm with partial operating flexibility would exhaust its cash holdings in about two years. At that point, its current liabilities would increase, on average, by eight times, suggesting that the average firm would have to resort to the debt market to prevent a liquidity crunch. Moreover, about 1/10th of all sample firms would become illiquid within six months.

We also find that AA analysts’ forecast optimism is more positively associated with the likelihood of MEFs than non-AA analysts’ forecast optimism when the firm is covered by AA analysts. Analyses based on AA analyst coverage changes and AA status changes confirm the relation between analyst reputation and MEFs. We further find that analyst reputation influences other MEF properties, such as forecast news, bias, and revisions, and that our results are robust to alternative measures of analyst reputation. Further analyses show that market reactions at quarterly earnings announcements are more positive (negative) when firms meet/beat (miss) AA analysts’ forecasts than when firms meet/beat (miss) non-AA analysts’ forecasts.

Internal control regulation under manipulation-contingent enforcement not only provides incentives to invest in internal controls, but also improves manipulation deterrence when there are internal control weaknesses.

Using more recent data and an innovative design, we define LB engagements as those where the audit fee discount is at least 30 percent. We consider three research questions to understand the possible link between LB and audit quality. First, we investigate whether the two variables that are often associated with auditor independence in the literature—non-audit fees and client importance—are related to LB. Second, we test whether lowballing auditors recoup initial audit fee discounts in the future period. Lastly, we investigate the relation between recovery of audit fees and future audit quality. We find that non-audit fees in the first year of engagement are negatively related to the propensity to LB. LB is significantly positively related to client importance for client firms switching from a non-Big N to another non-Big N auditor while the relation is insignificant for client firms switching from a Big N to another Big N auditor. The results of non-audit fees and client importance indicate that economic dependence does not motivate audit firms to lowball. Further, lowballing auditors tend to recoup their initial fee discounts in subsequent periods via increases in audit fees. Using multiple measures of audit quality, we do not find a significant relation between recovery of audit fees and future audit quality. Overall, contrary to regulators’ concerns, our results suggest that LB does not impair audit quality. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Audit fees; Audit quality; Client importance; Fee recovery; Lowballing; Non-audit fees",,"Cho, M.; Department of Accounting, 1 Pace Plaza, 4th Floor, United States; email: mcho@pace.edu",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

The existing evidence is ambiguous at best and scarce, which provides opportunities for further accounting studies in this area. Therefore, based on an agency theory framework, we fill this important research gap by exploring three determinants of audit report modifications in municipalities: (1) economic performance, (2) decentralization of decision-making across different decision-making bodies, and (3) political competition between political parties in local councils. These determinants are examined based on a large panel of data on Finnish municipalities for the period from 2009 to 2013, covering virtually all of the country's municipalities. We find that a striking 33 percent of audit reports had modifications during this period, which raises serious concerns about the state of municipal management, accounting, and auditing in Finland. Regarding the above determinants, the following conclusions can be made based on our analyses. First, we find partial evidence that weak economic performance increases the likelihood of audit report modifications. Second, the lower the competition among political parties in a local council, the lower the likelihood of audit report modifications. Finally, the more decentralized decision making is across the different decision-making bodies under the local council, the higher the probability of audit report modifications. These results are consistent with agency theory's explanations regarding the value of auditing. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Audit report modifications; Auditing; Decentralization of decision-making; Economic performance; Municipality; Political competition",,"Paananen, M.; Tampere University, Finland; email: mikko.paananen@thl.fi",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

First, MBE is not unequivocally associated with aggressive earnings management. Second, MBE does not necessarily obfuscate the truth. Third, MBE may be consistent with the well-documented reporting strategy of smoothing. Specifically, we characterize the reporting strategy of firms that engage in MBE in a two-period game. Some firms value MBE in the first period more than in the second (short-run firms), and other firms are less concerned with missing a threshold in the first period but must meet or beat expectations in the second (long-run firms). The analysis yields additional insights: we also show that MBE, by a small amount, is driven by the demand for a truth-revealing report, since the extremely small margin is designed to vary with the truth. In addition, MBE explains the richness of the menu of reporting strategies (“taking a bath,” “cookie-jar reserve,” and marginal threshold beating). Moreover, MBE is good news when the firm is a long-run MBE firm because it signals that the firm will also meet or beat expectations in the future. Finally, MBE has a favorable economic effect, as it induces boards of directors to incentivize managers to expend more effort. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Earnings management; Meeting or beating expectations; Repeated principal-agent contract; Smoothing; “Big bath”; “Cookie-jar reserve”; “Taking a bath”",,"Fogel-Yaari, H.; Tulane University, 7 McAlister Dr., United States; email: hfogelya@tulane.edu",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

We find that negative abnormal employment changes are associated with a higher likelihood of subsequent financial restatements, accounting irregularities, and lawsuits related to accounting fraud, and generally require greater effort from auditors as manifested by higher audit fees and longer audit report lags. Positive abnormal employment changes are associated with subsequent restatements and longer audit report lags, but not associated with fraud or audit fees. Taken together, the results are consistent with auditors recognizing the individual misstatement risks pertaining to companies’ employment decisions.

However, results in the overall literature have failed to reach consensus on this issue. We contribute to this debate by arguing that the audit market is segmented and that concentration in the Big 4 segment of the market leads to higher audit pricing. Accordingly, our analyses use international data and focus on concentration within the Big 4 group of firms across countries. We find that audit fees are increasing in our concentration measure for clients where the barriers to entry by competing auditors are higher, as proxied by client size, international operations, and IFRS use. Finally, we find evidence that audit quality is decreasing in Big 4 market concentration for these types of engagements. This indicates a wealth transfer from shareholders to audit firms when auditor concentration is high because these complex clients are charged more, but receive audits that are of lower quality. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Audit fees; Audit market concentration; Audit pricing; Client complexity; Cross-country audit fees; Global audit fees; International Financial Reporting Standards",,"Michas, P.N.; Eller College of Management, United States; email: paulmichas@email.arizona.edu",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

We contribute to the scarce literature on the relationship between risk governance and risk-taking behaviour and investigate IBs in this context. Using a sample of 573 observations representing 65 banks (28 CBs and 37 IBs) in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region from 2005 to 2015, we find a negative association between the risk governance indices and their risk perspectives across both types of banks for the post-crisis period. Interestingly, we find that the existence of risk governance mechanisms in IBs is associated with higher risk taking for the pre-crisis period, i.e., before the recent amendments to the risk governance principles in the MENA region. This result implies that IBs can respond to regulatory reforms in the post-crisis period by curbing excessive risk taking. We offer further evidence that the risk governance effect on overall risk taking stems only from the stand-alone board-level RC and not from the role of the CRO. We note that the CBs’ performance is more associated with risk taking for banks with stronger board-level RCs.

This suggests that the improved comparability increases the usefulness of equity-based compensation and a firm is willing to offer more equity-based compensation contracts to CEOs and increase their pay-performance sensitivity. Further, we find that the impact of comparability on the CEO's compensation contract increases with information asymmetry, which is consistent with the notion that accounting comparability is a quality of financial reporting that facilitates the use of equity-based compensation in a poor information environment. Our analysis also reveals that the effect of accounting comparability on CEO compensation structure is greater when a firm's corporate governance is strong, consistent with the complementary relation between comparability and the exiting corporate governance in determining CEO compensation schemes. Overall, our evidence suggests that firms utilize more equity-based compensation as a proportion of total compensation under greater accounting comparability and enhance the alignment between equity-based compensation and firm performance. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Accounting comparability; Compensation structure; Corporate governance; Equity-based compensation; Information asymmetry; Pay-performance sensitivity",,"Suh, S.; Robert J.

When economic policy is relatively uncertain, it is easier for bank managers to distort financial information, as unpredictable economic policy changes make assessing the existence and impact of hidden “adverse news” more difficult for investors and creditors. Economic policy uncertainty also increases the fluctuation in banks’ earnings and cash flows, thus providing additional incentives and opportunities for bank managers to engage in earnings management. Our results show that uncertainty in economic policy is positively related to earnings opacity, proxied by the magnitude of discretionary loan loss provisions and the likelihood of just meeting or beating the prior year's earnings, and negatively related to the level of accounting conservatism (i.e., the timeliness of recognition of bad news relative to good news).

First, we consider whether reforms to the standard prescribing the format of the income statement (AASB 1018) introduced during 2001/02 reduced the extent to which core expenses were opportunistically misclassified as ‘abnormal’ in an attempt to boost ‘core earnings’ (the ‘direct effect’), and whether any reduction in classification shifting behavior induced greater use of accrual-based earnings management (the ‘substitution effect’). We then examine the impact of the introduction of AASB 101 in 2005, which effectively reversed the constraints on classification shifting introduced in 2001/02. We find that classification shifting using abnormal items was significantly reduced following the 2001/02 reform. However, this reform also appears to have induced an increased use of accruals management to manipulate core earnings, thus potentially impairing earnings quality. We find some weak evidence of an increase in classification shifting behavior following the adoption of AASB 101, but no evidence of any substitution effects involving accrual-based earnings management. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Abnormal items; Accounting regulation; Classification shifting; Core earnings; Earnings management",,"Seve, F.; Faculty of Business and Entrepreneurship, Samoa; email: f.seve@nus.edu.ws",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

We find no significant change in the reported number of geographic segments, country segments, or line items per geographic segment disclosed in segment reporting notes after the introduction of CBCR. Consistent with the notion that EU banks may aggregate geographic segments to obfuscate tax haven activities, we find a positive association between tax haven intensity and geographic segment aggregation. Further, we document the location of banks’ operations and the extent of their economic presence in tax havens. We find that EU banks report significantly higher profit margins, turnover per employee, and profit per employee, and lower book effective tax rates for operations located in tax havens, relative to non-tax havens. Our evidence suggests that mandatory public CBCR has limited impact on geographic segment reporting. Nevertheless, CBCR provides additional information to better identify the existence and scale of tax haven involvement.

In our setting, owners seek accurate reports of financial performance whereas managers have incentives to distort performance reports in a self-serving fashion. Regulatory responses to such conflicts often call for improved disclosure, including more accountability and transparency (e.g., Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Dodd-Frank Act). We use the term accountability to imply answerability—wherein managers are required to reconcile the difference between reported and actual performance. We predict and find that when managers’ incentives are transparently disclosed, accountability does not rein in managers’ opportunistic reporting. By comparison, when managers’ incentives are less transparently disclosed (opaque), accountability dampens managers’ propensity to misreport. However, this reduction in opportunistic reporting due to accountability comes about because managers offset higher reporting bias in compensation periods with lower reporting bias in other periods. Therefore, not only are the benefits of accountability restricted to the setting where managers’ incentives are opaque, but the reduced reporting bias might arise due to window-dressing. Although managers seem to care enough about accountability to engage in window-dressing, financial incentives seem to dominate accountability, at least in our setting. We also find that managers’ payoffs are higher when their incentives are opaque, but owners’ payoffs are invariant regardless of whether incentives are transparent or opaque. Our analyses suggest that owners may be relying on accountability to curb opportunistic reporting by managers—a reliance that may be misplaced. Our findings have implications for regulatory responses aimed at addressing conflicts of interest. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Venkataraman, S.; Bentley UniversityUnited States; email: svenkataraman@bentley.edu",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

In response, the IASB has, over more than a decade, sought to increase user centricity, adapting its people and processes to more fully engage the views of users. We report on our empirical analysis from the standard setter's perspective of user engagement which is a research objective not documented in the prior literature. Our results draw on interviews conducted with 31 IASB representatives, comprised of 26 staff and 5 Board members representing approximately 60% of IASB's non-support staff as well as publically available archival data. We deploy the Griffiths (1960) citizenship participation framework in reporting on the procedural rigor directed at user utility, to assess IASB's attempt to enhance its perceived relevance (existential enhancement) as a standard setting body. We explain how a “clash” between new user centric practices and the extant practices led to challenges for the IASB in factoring the views of, and acting in the interest of users, as demanded by regulatory authorities. We discuss some of the tensions this has made evident in IASB's objective to function as an effective standard setter. Conceptually, our paper clarifies how more embedded representation modes per Griffith (1960) elicited greater user feedback, but that tensions arose in relation to the IASB's broader objectives to more directly serve users’ interests. Functionally, we offer a more nuanced appreciation for why the IASB might not unilaterally seek to be “user-focused” in the interests of both users and other stakeholders, and in doing so, serve the longer term objectives of accounting standard setting. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Sivabalan, P.; UTS Business SchoolAustralia; email: prabhu.sivabalan@uts.edu.au",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

It might be expected that this increase in the MLR would result in a decrease in premium dollars available to cover selling, general and administrative costs (SG&A) and a concomitant decrease in profits. However, there is earlier evidence that SG&A “cost stickiness” presents a counter-effect in this instance: namely, that an increase in SG&A costs per each dollar of revenue increase is more than the magnitude of a decrease in SG&A costs per each dollar of revenue decrease. In this context, this paper offers the first preliminary evidence of the impact of the MLR regulatory change on SG&A cost stickiness in the health insurance industry. Applying the Anderson et al. (2003) methodology, our sample of publicly-traded health insurers shows evidence of significant mitigation of the SG&A cost stickiness after the implementation of the ACA medical loss ratio rules and that in periods of revenue declines, SG&A costs decreased more significantly post-ACA than pre-ACA. These results further illustrate the tension created by regulatory policy designed to improve healthcare cost efficiency and its impact on the profit seeking activities of for-profit healthcare enterprises. Thus, this paper contributes to both healthcare and accounting literature by documenting a significant effect of regulatory policy on managerial decisions regarding cost control. © 2019","Cost stickiness; Medical loss ratio; MLR; Selling general and administrative costs",,"Surysekar, K.; School of Accounting, United States",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

Accounting firms, as well as other firms providing risk advisory services, are concerned about their clients’ potential and actual breaches. Organizations cannot, however, eliminate all cybersecurity risks so as to achieve 100% security. Furthermore, at some point additional cybersecurity measures become more costly than the benefits from the incremental security. Thus, those responsible for preventing cybersecurity breaches within their organizations, as well as those providing risk advisory services to those organizations, need to think in terms of the cost-benefit aspects of cybersecurity investments. Besides investing in activities that prevent or mitigate the negative effects of cybersecurity breaches, organizations can invest in cybersecurity insurance as means of transferring some of the cybersecurity risks associated with potential future breaches. This paper provides a model for selecting the optimal set of cybersecurity insurance policies by a firm, given a finite number of policies being offered by one or more insurance companies. The optimal set of policies for the firm determined by this selection model can (and often does) contain at least three areas of possible losses not covered by the selected policies (called the Non-Coverage areas in this paper). By considering sets of insurance policies with three or more Non-Coverage areas, we show that a firm is often better able to address the frequently cited problems of high deductibles and low ceilings common in today's cybersecurity insurance marketplace. Our selection model facilitates improved risk-sharing among cybersecurity insurance purchasers and sellers. As such, our model provides a basis for a more efficient cybersecurity insurance marketplace than currently exists. Our model is developed from the perspective of a firm purchasing the insurance policies (or the risk advisors guiding the firm) and assumes the firm's objective in purchasing cybersecurity insurance is to minimize the sum of the costs of the premiums associated with the cybersecurity insurance policies selected and the sum of the expected losses not covered by the insurance policies. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Cybersecurity insurance; Cybersecurity risk management",,"Loeb, M.P.; Accounting and Information Assurance, United States; email: mloeb@rhsmith.umd.edu",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

It extends and updates Gordon et al.

Since publication of their paper, cyber-related events have become more frequent and salient, and disclosure of cybersecurity issues has become more extensive. Increased disclosure is largely due to a 2011 requirement by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which provides guidance for disclosure of cyber-related issues in 10-K filings. Based upon this post-guidance disclosure, we develop a new measure that captures the extent and relevance of cyber disclosures and show that the market positively values cybersecurity awareness. We also show that a more negative tone in cyber disclosures is associated with lower market values.

The academic literature, however, is largely silent on post-audit of such investments, which is a formal evaluation of IT resource allocation decisions. IT post-audits are considered a useful risk management tool for organizations and are often emphasized in security certifications and standards. To fill this research gap and contribute to practice, we suggest post-auditing of IT security investments using the generic Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation approach. This approach does not place stringent conjugate assumptions and can handle high-dimensional Bayesian post-audit inference problems often associated with information security resource allocation decisions. We develop two Bayesian post-audit models using the MCMC method: (1) measuring the effectiveness of an IT security investment using posterior mean score ratios (MSR), and posterior crossover error rates (CER); and (2) measuring the effectiveness through detection of a denial of service (DOS) attack using Bayesian estimation to statistically compare the degree of divergence using the concept of entropy. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed methodology using an email intrusion detection system application. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Bayesian post-audit; Denial of service (DOS) attacks; Entropy; Information security investments; Intrusion detection systems (IDS); Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation; Post-audit",,"Herath, H.S.B.; Department of Accounting, GSB235, 1812 Sir Isaac Brock Way, Canada; email: hherath@brocku.ca",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

We provide such evidence, and our use of Form 10-K contents related to trade secrets is a first step toward determining whether corporations actually attract Breach activity through their public disclosures. We find that firms mentioning the existence of trade secrets have a significantly higher subsequent probability of being Breached relative to firms that do not do so. Our results are stronger among younger firms, firms with fewer employees, and firms operating in less concentrated industries. By conducting a battery of additional tests, we attempt to go beyond merely establishing correlations to provide evidence whether such proprietary information can actually attract cyber attacks.

However, such an association is negatively moderated when the audit firm has industry-specific expertise, longer experience with the client, and is one of the Big 4 firms.

Other literatures have concluded that, when stock prices are high and rising, M&A is higher, more M&A is financed with stock, market sentiment and stockholders’ perceptions of information appear to change, and in these circumstances new (arbitrage) motivations for M&A emerge. This paper revisits earnings management ahead of M&A in the light of these findings, comparing experience in ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ markets. It finds that such earnings management is more pronounced in hot markets; that only in such markets are positive discretionary accruals commonly associated with positive abnormal returns on the announcement of earnings; and that in such markets – against the expectations from signalling theory – these positive returns are not reversed on announcement of a stock-for-stock bid. The results suggest that the economic benefits achieved by engaging in earnings management during hot markets are indeed significant: in hot markets, we estimate that on average share acquirers engage in working capital accrual management equivalent to over a third of the average acquirer's return on total assets in that year; and that this earnings management is associated with increases in market value which are statistically and economically significant, enabling the bidder to secure control of the target with fewer shares. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Abnormal returns; Earnings management; M&A; Market sentiment",,"Botsari, A.; European Investment Fund - Research & Market Analysis, 37B Avenue J.F.

The improvement is most significant in the year following CEO resignation. In addition, TARP banks that kept their CEOs show a significant increase in CEO pensions post-TARP.

We also examine whether the influence of accounting enforcement on bank earnings quality changed after the global financial crisis. Using a sample of listed banks from 40 countries between 2001 and 2014, and abnormal loan loss provisions (ALLP) as our main proxy for earnings quality, we document a consistent and strong association between accounting enforcement and bank earnings quality. More specifically, an increase in accounting enforcement decreases the level of ALLP and decreases the propensity to manage earnings to avoid losses. Furthermore, we provide empirical evidence that bank regulation complements the effect of accounting enforcement on bank earnings quality. Finally, unlike in the pre-crisis period, we find a positive association between accounting enforcement and income-decreasing ALLP in the post-crisis period, which indicates that stronger accounting enforcement is associated with more conservative earnings and higher loan loss reserves.

We first confirm the intuition in the FASB's (2010) current conceptual framework by documenting that the short-window earnings response coefficient (ERC) is positively associated with the pre-determined level of comparability. Using the cross-sectional variation in the positive relation between ERC and comparability, we show that the link between ERC and comparability is more pronounced for firms with higher investor sophistication and lower information asymmetry among investors. We further support our predictions using analysts’ earnings forecast revisions and various alternative measures of earnings informativeness. In sum, our paper shows that comparability improves information users’ ability to identify similarities and differences across different firms to a greater extent when investor base is more sophisticated and private information is less prevalent. These results suggest that standard setters, regulators, and practitioners should devote more attention to the role of comparability in firms whose investors are less sophisticated and information environment is more opaque. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Comparability; Conceptual framework; Information asymmetry; Investor sophistication; Relevance",,"Kim, S.; University of Massachusetts Boston, 100 Morrissey Blvd., United States; email: sangwan.kim@umb.edu",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

First, we focus on the CFO role as a determinant of CFO compensation. Like prior work, we proxy for CFO roles by using hand-collected public data on education and past professional experience, but we supplement these proxies with proprietary data to more directly capture the firm-specific nature of the CFO job in term of its similarity with that of the CEO. We thus argue how CFOs can have varied roles characterized by different levels of financial expertise and CEO-likeness, and document that it is this latter aspect that is associated with CFO compensation. Second, we study the effects of CFO compensation design on outcomes in the CFO's realm related to financial reporting. We find that CFO financial expertise is positively associated with financial reporting quality, while a CFO's pay long-term incentive intensity and a CFO's incentive compensation proximity with the CEO are negatively associated with financial reporting quality. Overall, then, our results suggest that CFOs get rewarded for their CEO-likeness, and particularly for their being similar to the CEO in terms of tasks and decision making authority. But it is their financial expertise that is positively related to financial reporting quality. At the same time, using compensation that is more incentive intensive and more similar to that of the CEO appears to be potentially detrimental to the quality of financial reporting. These results are relevant for boards involved in selecting highly expert CFOs, and their compensation committees charged with defining subsequently effective incentive compensation plans for those CFOs. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","CFO compensation determinants; CFO compensation effects; CFO incentive compensation; CFO role; Chief Financial Officer (CFO)",,"Van der Stede, W.A.; Department of Accounting, Houghton Street, United Kingdom; email: w.van-der-stede@lse.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

The purpose of this study is to determine if the DSH program's 100-bed threshold influences bed capacity planning. We find that the threshold drives a significant discontinuity in the distribution of urban hospital bed capacities, with hospitals tending to maintain just enough beds to qualify for higher DSH payments. The magnitude of the discontinuity is greatest in hospitals with strong incentives to manage bed capacity; and, compared to government and not-for-profit hospitals, for-profit hospitals are more likely to manage capacity to meet the 100-bed threshold.

By discussing both current regimes and proposed projects, we develop and illustrate a typology of regulatory approaches to performance reporting. These range from command and control, where standard-setters mandate specific performance reporting standards, through to market regulation, where charities and/or sector bodies acting as regulatory entrepreneurs determine what is to be reported. Between these extremes, the typology describes new governance approaches, with standard-setters partnering and collaborating with other actors. These approaches lead to different requirements with potentially significant implications for performance accountability in the respective jurisdictions.

Beginning in 2010, US companies are required to report their GHG emissions to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We utilize these data for 2010–2014 to examine whether the possible adverse firm value impact of these GHG emissions is alleviated or exacerbated by the firm's reputation for corporate social responsibility. Our findings suggest that there is no halo effect, i.e., a firm's reputation for social responsibility (as reflected in its CSR score) does not protect the firm from the adverse firm value effects of GHG emissions. Rather, our findings suggest a fallen angel effect, i.e., for any given level of GHG emissions, the higher the firm's CSR score, the greater the adverse impact on firm value. In other words, the decline in firm value due to the adverse impact of GHG emissions is compounded by the hit to the firm's reputation for corporate social performance. Our paper contributes to the sparse prior US literature on the firm value effects of GHG emissions. Further, by providing scholarly evidence on the existence of a fallen angel effect, our findings suggest that boards and managers of firms that provide voluntary CSR disclosures cannot afford to be complacent about their GHG emissions. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Corporate social responsibility; Firm value; Greenhouse gas emissions; Greenwashing",,"Cooper, S.A.; Department of Accounting and Legal Studies, United States; email: sacooper@salisbury.edu",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

In this study, the relationship between municipal elections and internal control weaknesses is examined. As elections have been shown to improve public officials’ performance via accountability, appropriate use of elections is expected to have a pivotal effect on a municipality, ultimately impacting the operating effectiveness of the internal control system. Two election variables – election of the Finance official and use of term limits for City Council and the mayor – are evaluated to determine if a relationship with the prevalence of internal control weaknesses reported exists. The contribution of this study is the finding that both the use of term limits and election of the Finance official are associated with fewer instances of internal control weaknesses, implying that these election policies have a meaningful effect on governance quality, impacting the effectiveness of internal controls. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Electoral control; Internal control weaknesses; Material weakness; Municipal audit; Municipal fraud; Municipal governance",,,,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

However, few papers have explored the impact of the Security and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletins (SABs) 99-100 in the year 2000 following their passage in late 1999. As a result, some of the reductions in earnings management that prior research attributes to SOX may have been due to these two SABs. We find that in 2000 there was a significant decline in the zero earnings discontinuity in quarterly earnings considered by prior research to be evidence of earnings management to avoid small losses. Surprisingly, we find only mixed evidence that SOX provided an incremental impact to that of the SABs, which occurs mainly in the quarterly distribution of EPS rather than in scaled quarterly earnings. We also find evidence that the passage of the SABs significantly reduced the practice where firms take write-offs in the fourth quarter that turn a profit for the year into a loss.

This study uses the unique setting of CSR restatements to examine these issues. We present theoretical and empirical evidence supporting a competitive advantage of using accounting firms as assurance providers as they not only identify inaccuracies in previous reports earlier than non-accounting providers, but also prevent future reporting inaccuracies. CSR assurance, from either type of provider, also leads to improved reporting definitions, scopes, and methodologies that require restatements for comparability. Results also indicate that CSR reporting frameworks (e.g., GRI) are not a substitute for obtaining CSR assurance as the latter has incremental benefits over GRI usage in terms of identifying errors and reporting improvements. These results have implications for public policy makers considering the merits of mandating CSR assurance and for organizations assessing the relative benefits and costs of preparing GRI-based CSR reports, obtaining CSR assurance, and choosing between accounting vs. non-accounting CSR assurance providers. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Assurance; Corporate social responsibility; Reporting frameworks; Restatements",,"Chen, P.-C.; Miami UniversityUnited States; email: chenpo@miamioh.edu",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

Focusing on grants related to assets, we trace the development of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 20, outline some of the problems of current accounting practice, and suggest why these have not been addressed by the standard-setter. Then, by hand-collecting data relating to 559 firms from 15 countries, we empirically analyze several issues. We show that asset grants are economically important for some firms and that the frequency of grants is significantly different across the countries. For the non-financial firms in our sample, we identify the grant-related accounting policy choice: a firm can either show the grant as deferred income or net it against the asset. The options are roughly equally popular overall but the firm's country of domicile is strongly associated with the choice. Further, as a key element of disclosure quality for this topic, we investigate whether or not the balance sheet-related numbers relating to grants are disclosed, finding that many firms do not disclose them. Disclosure quality is better for firms which use the ‘deferred income’ option, and it is also better in countries where a higher proportion of firms has received government grants. International differences and poor disclosure are detrimental to international comparisons, so we conclude that the policy choice should be removed from the accounting standard. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Accounting choice; Government grants; IAS 20; International differences",,"Stadler, C.; Department of Accounting and Finance, United Kingdom; email: c.stadler@lancaster.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

Finally, since the proper classification within the SCF is a current regulatory issue, we examine whether classification shifting within the SCFs impacts the market.

First, we find that although both LAFs and SAFs experience audit fee shocks attributable to 404(b), SAFs on average experience relatively greater fee shocks than LAFs (107.8% versus 84.6%; Table 6). Second, even though NAFs are not subject to 404(b) procedures, we document a 42.7% fee shock for NAFs. Our interpretation is that 404(b) generated an immediate increase in demand for audit services with no corresponding sudden increase in supply of experienced audit personnel, enabling audit firms to charge higher prices for all filers including NAFs. We find that audit fee shocks attributable to 404(b) are positively associated with audit offices’ bargaining power relative to clients, and that the effect of offices’ bargaining power is strongest for SAFs and weakest for NAFs. Although higher audit fees (with client characteristics held constant) are often considered an indicator of better audit quality, we find virtually no evidence that the massive fee increases in 2004 are accompanied by improvements in same-year or next-year audit quality, measured as decreases in discretionary accruals and a lower likelihood of subsequent restatements of audited financial reports. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Accelerated filers; Audit fees; Audit office; Bargaining power; Internal controls; Non-accelerated filers; SOX 404(b)",,"Ettredge, M.; University of KansasUnited States; email: mettredge@ku.edu",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

We investigate business strategy as a determinant of annual report readability. As business strategy fundamentally determines a firm's product and market domain, technology, and organizational structure, it influences a firm's operating complexity, environmental uncertainty and information asymmetry. Consequently, business strategy frames the level, wording, and complexity of disclosures. We capture a firm's business strategy based on the Miles and Snow (1978) strategic typology and measure 10-K readability with Li's (2008) Fog index. We find that firms pursuing an innovation-oriented prospector strategy have less readable 10-Ks relative to firms pursuing an efficiency-oriented defender strategy. We also find that prospectors display more negative and uncertainty tones while defenders exhibit more litigious tone in their 10-Ks.

The findings support the view that industry self-regulating initiatives could prove effective and they are recognized as such by financial markets.

However, as a competing hypothesis, we argue that entrenchment can also provide benefits for the firm's owners: it leads managers to be less myopic in managing earnings to meet short-term financial reporting goals. Our findings are consistent with this prediction as they suggest that, when there are incentives to manipulate firms’ performance, entrenched managers are less prone to engage in earnings management activities that hurt shareholders. Specifically, we focus on firms that just meet or marginally beat earnings benchmarks and document a negative association between managerial entrenchment and both the opportunistic use of accruals and the manipulation of real activities. We also show that earnings management is less detrimental to firm value if the manager is entrenched.

Although the SEC dedicates significant resources to the filing review process, the efficacy of this process is unclear. Upon receipt of a comment letter consequent to the SEC's review, the firm can either remedy perceived disclosure deficiencies or attempt to avoid making substantive disclosure changes, including by requesting that certain additional information be treated as confidential or by negotiating with the SEC. In this paper, we first examine the nature, extent, and impact of modifications to firms’ disclosures requested by an SEC comment letter. While our initial evidence suggests that firms enhance their disclosure, we find that Rule 406 confidential treatment requests and registrant negotiation have an attenuating effect. Further, consistent with proprietary cost concerns, we show that firms in high tech industries and with greater amounts of R&D are more likely to request confidential treatment. We then examine informational transparency in order to test the SEC's stated intention of the filing review process. We find that improvements to firms’ disclosures following a comment letter are associated with a decrease in information asymmetry and a reduction in litigation risk. Collectively, our paper contributes to the literature on disclosure regulation by providing evidence that the SEC comment letter process generally enhances firms’ disclosures, improves informational transparency for investors, and mitigates firms’ litigation risk, but that some firms take actions that diminish these enhancements. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Comment letters; Corporate disclosure; Disclosure regulation; SEC",,"Bozanic, Z.; The Ohio State University, 2100 Neil Avenue, United States; email: bozanic.1@fisher.osu.edu",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

We argue that firm managers will imitate their interlocked-partner firm's accounting method choices when choosing their own accounting methods. We find that when there is an interlock relationship between two firms, their accounting method choices, including inventory and depreciation methods, are similar to each other, indicating that accounting method choices can diffuse across firms through director interlock. In addition, such similarity is greater the longer the interlock relationship between the two firms is and as uncertainty increases. Further, the interlock effect on depreciation methods is larger for firms whose interlock directors have accounting backgrounds.

However, little is known about whether reporting framework choice affects users’ assessments of reporting quality and subsequent business decisions. This study evaluates the effects of financial reporting framework type and credit risk on lenders’ judgments and decisions. Specifically, we evaluate 157 lenders’ assessments of the likelihood of loan approval and financial reporting quality for a prospective borrower in an experiment that manipulates reporting framework choice (FASB-based GAAP, AICPA's Financial Reporting Framework for Small and Medium-Sized Entities, or tax-basis) and borrower credit risk level (high or low) randomly between subjects. The results indicate a significant interaction between applicant reporting framework and credit risk level. Specifically, we find that lenders evaluating GAAP-based financial statements report a higher likelihood of loan approval and a lower interest rate than lenders considering statements prepared using the other reporting frameworks, particularly when the applicant's credit risk level is high. Mediation analysis provides evidence that the perceived quality of GAAP-based reporting explains the framework-approval results. However, the results also suggest that the AICPA reporting framework provides a viable alternative to GAAP when the applicant's credit risk level is low.

Using a generalized method of moments (GMM) model to control for endogeneity, we find that the discretionary earnings management activity of borrowers favours larger loan amounts, both ex post and ex ante. By contrast, we find no impact of borrowers’ earnings management activity on the costs of loans. Interestingly, we find that the relationship between earnings management and firms’ borrowing capacity is not significant before the enactment of the Basel II regulation; however, in the period following its enactment, we find a positive and systematic impact of earnings management (both ex post and ex ante) on the amount of bank loans, as well as some positive impact on the costs of bank loans. Our results indicate that borrowers manage earnings to signal better quality to lenders and to ameliorate their borrowing capacities, regardless of the excessive costs of doing so. In addition, we find that the introduction of the Basel II rules likely strengthened this tendency. The findings of this research should alert bank regulators to the feasibility of an unintended economic consequence of rigid discipline with respect to bank risk taking—namely, reducing borrowers’ transparency may lead to less prudent assessments of borrowers’ creditworthiness. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Basel II; Borrowing capacity; Creditworthiness; Earnings management; Private firms; Private loans; Unintended consequences of regulation",,"Mafrolla, E.; Department of Economics, Via Caggese, 1, Italy; email: elisabetta.mafrolla@unifg.it",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

An Integrated Report (IR) should communicate “concisely” about how a firm's strategy, governance, performance and prospects, in the context of its external environment, lead to the creation of sustainable value. At the same time, an IR needs to be “complete and balanced”, i.e., broadly including all material matters, both positive and negative, in a balanced way. Drawing on impression management studies, we examine a selection of performance determinants to gain insights into the factors associated with conciseness, completeness and balance in IR. The results from a sample of IR early adopters show that in the presence of a firm's weak financial performance, the IR tends to be significantly longer and less readable (i.e., less concise), and more optimistic (i.e., less balanced). We additionally find that firms with worse social performance provide reports that are foggier (i.e., less concise) and with less information on their sustainability performance (i.e., less complete). Our evidence implies that IR early adopters employ quantity and syntactical reading ease manipulation as well as thematic content and verbal tone manipulation as impression management strategies. The results also suggest that such strategies depend not only on the level of firms’ performance but also on the type of performance (financial versus nonfinancial/sustainability). This paper adds to the limited literature on IR in sustainability accounting as well as to the research in mainstream financial accounting that examines disclosure quality using textual analysis. © 2017","Balance; Completeness; Conciseness; Disclosure; Impression management; Integrated Reporting; Sustainability; Textual analysis",,"Caglio, A.; Bocconi University, Via Roentgen 1, Italy; email: ariela.caglio@sdabocconi.it",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

On 2 December 2013, pollution reached new levels, with the air quality index crossing the threshold from “very unhealthy” into “hazardous”. We take this exogenous event, along with related increases in outrage and governmental attention, as an opportunity to explore market valuation of expected regulatory costs. Contrary to research indicating government protection of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) (e.g., Berkman et al., 2010), we find evidence supporting market expectations of larger haze-related regulatory costs for SOEs versus non-state-owned enterprises (NSOEs). We also find evidence that the market initially expected firms that provide corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports and firms in high polluting industries would be relatively shielded from higher regulatory costs. However, this changed following increased outrage and government attention to haze, with resulting larger expected regulatory costs. Our evidence is also consistent with initial market expectation that firms located closer to Beijing would be shielded, but this expectation changed over time. Overall, expected regulatory costs appear to have increased over time, reducing the market valuation of SOEs, CSR reporters, and firms in polluting industries over the longer term. Increased occurrence of haze events in other countries (e.g., more recent events in India, Indonesia) will likely result in similar expected increases in regulatory costs. Further, our study underscores the existence of material impacts on firms related to environmental events that are beyond firms’ control. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","CSR disclosure; Haze; Polluting industries; Regulatory costs; State-Owned Enterprises",,"Soderstrom, N.S.; Department of Accounting, Australia; email: naomiss@unimelb.edu.au",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

We investigate the determinants and consequences of the decisions made by French firms to use press releases in order to announce downsizing operations. We also examine whether the content of press releases has an impact on investor reactions to downsizing announcements. Particularly in the French context, downsizing operations reflect negatively on corporate social responsibility with respect to employees, and we anticipate that French managers will use disclosure strategies to counter a potential legitimacy threat. Our sample consists of 227 downsizing operations announced between 2007 and 2012 by 119 French listed firms. We find that the disclosure of press releases is driven by both contextual and legitimacy factors. We also find that press releases are associated with more negative reactions to downsizing announcements than when there is no press release, particularly in the case of proactive operations (i.e., implemented by firms with improving performance). A content analysis of press releases indicates that firms, on average, engage in a reactive impression management strategy in their disclosure that consists of attributing downsizing operations to external factors. Moreover, investors penalize the use of proactive arguments, particularly when they are used to justify proactive operations. Overall, our results show that, in the French case, disclosure strategies and their consequences on the financial markets relate to a legitimacy perspective. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Disclosure strategies; Downsizing operations; Impression management; Legitimacy theory; Press releases",,"Cho, C.H.; Schulich School of Business, 4700 Keele Street, Canada; email: ccho@schulich.yorku.ca",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

This effect is concentrated among the non-state-owned enterprises (NSOEs) rather than the state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and especially when subsidies are granted through non-tax based rather than tax-based channels.

Overall, our evidence suggests that accrual quality of private U.S. firms is useful, has economic consequences, and varies predictably with certain firm characteristics. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Accrual quality; Cash-flow prediction; Demand factors; Private firms; Stakeholders",,"Thomas, W.B.; Michael F.

The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) provides a unique setting that allows us to examine the determinants of these two sequential disclosure decisions, first to respond to the CDP questionnaire and second to publish this response. We apply a sequential logit approach to analyze a panel dataset that contains 11,187 firm-year observations across 60 countries from 2006 to 2010. Our results indicate that the determinants of the response decision differ from the determinants of the publication decision. Specifically, the response decision is related to the available financial resources, the existence of a certified environmental management system and the publication of corporate social responsibility reports (preparation costs), whereas the publication decision is associated with the environmental performance and the nature of the competitive environment (proprietary costs). Furthermore, our findings suggest that the voluntary disclosure perspective dominates the legitimacy perspective, explaining the association between environmental performance and the publication decision.

We find that larger firms and firms with greater deferred pension losses are more likely to adopt the MTM approach. On the other hand, we do not find an association between a firm's level of financial transparency or earnings volatility and MTM adoption. Further, our market tests reveal that investors reacted positively to the standalone announcements of MTM adoption and to the magnitude of the one-time pension loss adjustment upon adoption. Finally, in examining the consequences of MTM adoption, we find a reduction in earnings informativeness and an increase in plan assets allocated to debt relative to matched non-adopters.

Prior literature shows that higher proximity to political power leads to higher policy risk, i.e., uncertainty regarding the impact of future administration policies on the cash flow of the firm. An increase in policy risk implies an increase in the opaqueness of the information environment and in the expected volatility of future operating profitability; we argue that these effects both encourage and facilitate earnings management. Drawing on recent research in finance and political science, we use a measure of the alignment along party lines between politicians elected at the state level and the federally elected President as our main measure of proximity to political power. We find a significant positive association between the political alignment of firms’ home states and their level of absolute discretionary accruals.

Our results reveal that – consistent with voluntary disclosure theory – superior sustainability performers choose high-quality sustainability disclosure to signal their superior performance to the market. In addition, based on legitimacy theory, poor sustainability performers prefer low-quality sustainability disclosure to disguise their true performance and to simultaneously protect their legitimacy.

Early voluntary adopters had incentives to increase the transparency of their reporting in order to attract outside capital, while those firms that waited until IFRS adoption became mandatory in EU countries lacked incentives for transparent reporting leading to increases in earnings management (smoothing) after IFRS adoption. We maintain that the IFRS standards that went into effect in 2005 provide greater flexibility of accounting choices because of vague criteria, overt and covert options, and subjective estimates. This greater flexibility coupled with the lack of clear guidance on how to implement these new standards has led to greater earnings management (smoothing). Consistent with this view, we find an increase in earnings management (smoothing) from pre-2005 to post-2005 for firms in countries that allowed early IAS/IFRS adoption, as well as for firms in countries that did not allow early IFRS adoption.

Using a sample of Belgian private firms, the analyses provide evidence that banks charge lower interest rate spreads to voluntary adopters as compared to non-adopters. The results also show that loan sizes are larger in comparison for voluntary adopters of XBRL. Further, the effect of XBRL adoption is stronger for opaque firms. The results are robust to using different estimation approaches as well as additional tests.

In order to do so, we focus on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) and we examine whether the value relevance of summary accounting information (i.e., book value of equity and earnings) of firms listed on the JSE has enhanced after the mandatory adoption of an IR approach under the King III Report. Our study can be seen as a response to the recent calls for a closer investigation of the usefulness of the new reporting trend for investors. More specifically, our study can be seen as a response to the stance taken by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) Framework that the adoption of an IR approach improves the usefulness of financial reporting for investors. For our empirical tests we utilize a sample of 954 firm-year observations and employ a linear price-level model which associates a firm's market value of equity with its book value of equity and earnings. In line with the IIRC Framework's expectations, we find strong evidence of a sharp increase of the earnings’ valuation coefficient. However, contrary to the Framework's stance, our results indicate a decline in the value relevance of net assets. Such a decline may be imputed to risks and/or unbooked liabilities that are revealed or measured more reliably after the introduction of an IR approach on the JSE. It should be noted, however, that despite its cause, the decline in the value relevance of net assets can be seen as a further argument in favor of the IIRC stance to assign equal importance to a wide range of “capitals,” such as human, social and natural capital. We believe that our findings are of particular interest to a wide range of regulators, standards setters, practitioners, and academics but first and foremost to the JSE and IIRC. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Baboukardos, D.; Jönköping International Business School, Gjuterigatan 5, 551 11, PO Box 1026, Sweden; email: diogenis.baboukardos@ju.se",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

Swaps, by far, are the most popular derivative instrument. In terms of the determinants of derivative usage, we find that the propensity to use derivatives as well as the extent of derivative usage is higher for municipalities that are larger and more financially constrained. We do not find growth to be related to municipal derivative usage. Contrary to suggestions made in the popular press, we fail to find managerial opportunism to be a significant factor in municipal derivative usage.

We predicted that when the focus of the PCAOB inspection process is based on effectiveness, there would be no difference in the external auditors' planned reliance on the IAF (sensitivity to the risks of the tests) across the two levels of engagement risk and when the focus of the PCAOB inspection process is balanced (meaning both an effective and a efficiency focus), the external auditors' planned reliance will be higher in the low engagement risk condition compared to the high engagement risk condition. Contrary to our prediction, we find that when the focus of the PCAOB inspection process is balanced, auditors' reliance on the IAF is not impacted by engagement risk. However, when the PCAOB inspection process is focused on effectiveness, the auditors rely more on the IAF when engagement risk is low than when it is high. Thus, if the goal of Auditing Standard No. 5 (AS5) is to have external auditors be more sensitive to the risk of the tests to be performed, then the PCAOB's efficiency focus for inspections did not have the intended effect. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Messier, W.F.; University of NevadaUnited States; email: bill.messier@unlv.edu",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

However, there has been very little empirical investigation specifically aimed at understanding the link between audit fees and audit quality on new engagements. We examine a sample of initial engagements spanning 2000-2009 and find evidence suggesting that the magnitude of initial engagement discounting is positively associated with audit clients' ability to meet analyst forecasts using discretionary accruals. Additional analysis reveals that this effect is more pronounced before the passage of SOX. Further examination of the post-SOX period shows the effect is present in the latter half of our sample (2006-2009) but not in the years immediately following the passage of SOX (2002-2005).

Therefore, information about D&O policy details is potentially useful in assessing potential managerial opportunism. However, many countries, including the U.S., do not require firms to disclose this information. We provide evidence on whether mandatory D&O disclosures are likely to provide information about managerial opportunism that is incremental to that provided by other sources of information using a sample of Canadian firms, who are required to make D&O disclosures. We examine the association between excess D&O coverage limits and audit fees since auditors have extensive private information about the likelihood of managerial opportunism and strong incentives to incorporate this information into their audit fees. We find a positive association between excess D&O coverage limits and audit fees after controlling for numerous other audit fee determinants, including other proxies for managerial opportunism such as discretionary accruals and corporate governance variables. Additional analyses suggest auditors are more sensitive to potential managerial opportunism when managers are more likely to act on their opportunistic incentives. We also find a positive association between excess D&O coverage limits and the likelihood of future shareholder litigation. Our findings suggest that D&O insurance disclosures convey incremental information to shareholders and other capital market participants.

The extant fraud literature, including professional audit standards, focuses almost exclusively on the fraud triangle model (Cressey, 1973) and its components (i.e., pressure, opportunity, and rationalization) to explain the occurrence of fraud. However, the fraud triangle has not been tested empirically relative to other proposed fraud models designed to address the triangle's limitations. For example, Wolfe and Hermanson (2004) proposed a fraud diamond model that adds individual ""capability"" to the fraud triangle as a fourth component reflecting the personal skills and attributes needed to recognize and act on fraud opportunities in an organization. A sample of 89 auditors in public accounting participated in a 2. ×. 2 experiment with fraud model practice aid type (fraud triangle or fraud diamond) and CEO risk level (low or high) manipulated randomly between subjects in a fraud risk assessment task. The results indicate a significant fraud model type effect, with auditors evaluating fraud risk factors based on a fraud diamond practice aid providing significantly higher (more conservative) fraud risk assessments than auditors evaluating fraud risk factors based on a fraud triangle practice aid. Subsequent factor analysis provides initial support for a revised fraud triangle that includes pressure, opportunity, and a broader capability dimension (that includes rationalization/attitude) as the three formative components. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Hermanson, D.R.; Kennesaw State UniversityUnited States; email: dhermans@kennesaw.edu",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

This paper demonstrates how information sharing could encourage firms to take a more proactive, as compared to a reactive, approach toward cybersecurity investments. In particular, information sharing could reduce the tendency by firms to defer cybersecurity investments. The basic argument presented in this paper is grounded in the real options perspective of cybersecurity investments. More to the point, the value of an option to defer an investment in cybersecurity activities increases as the uncertainty associated with the investment increases. To the extent that information sharing reduces a firm's uncertainty concerning a cybersecurity investment, it decreases the value of the deferment option associated with the investment. As a result of this decrease in the deferment option value, it may well make economic sense for the firm to make the cybersecurity investment sooner than otherwise would be the case. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Loeb, M.P.; Robert H.

Previous studies explaining why ERM is implemented have been informative but overly simplified. The basic argument presented in this study is that ERM should be seen as a composition of traditional risk management and risk governance, each with their own determining factors. Implementation of risk governance is the active step beyond traditional risk management to ERM. This study addresses the complexity of ERM by dividing it into its traditional risk management and risk governance components and investigating the determinants of these components separately but simultaneously. Based on a survey of 145 firms, empirical evidence suggests that the level of risk governance in a firm is related to the size of the firm, leverage and dividend payments and the chief executive officer's influence on the board; this may suggest that corporate governance motives, like the need for governance, existing governance and the control a CEO has over governance decisions, determine the decision to take the step toward implementing ERM. This study is a step toward clarifying the existing ad hoc theoretical foundations of ERM and implies that firms are implementing ERM in accordance with stakeholder desires for better governance of the risk management system. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Lundqvist, S.A.; School of Economics and Management, Knut Wicksell Centre for Financial Studies, Lund University, Box 7080, Sweden",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

However, extant clawbacks (whether firm-initiated or as mandated by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act) do not go far enough in that they seem to allow executives to retain trading profits linked to sales of their own companies' shares at a time of inflated earnings (Fried and Shilon, 2011). In this paper, we examine the moderating effect of insider sales on the relation between firm-initiated clawback-adoptions and fraud risk. Our results indicate that clawback-adopting firms experience a decrease in fraud risk following adoption relative to non-adopters during the same time period. However, this decrease in fraud risk for the clawback-adopting firms is materially weakened in the presence of insider trading. At this time (July 2014), the SEC is still working on rules for implementing clawbacks (one of nearly half of the rules yet to be completed under Dodd-Frank). Our findings suggest that clawback rules (as and when issued by the SEC) need to address insider sales for clawbacks to be fully effective in mitigating the risk of fraudulent financial reporting. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.",,,"Sun, L.1155 Union Circle #305219, United States",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

The primary research question we address is whether RMC formation has a substantive effect on short-term risk outcomes and performance. Specifically, we determine whether RMCs are related to a short-term change in risk outcomes, a short-term change in hedging and trading derivative structures, and a short-term increase in profitability. We use a sample of financial institutions that voluntarily form a RMC in any year from 1994 through 2008 and a control sample of financial institutions that do not form a RMC during the sample period. The results provide evidence to suggest that financial institutions with international banking activity, higher leverage, a larger and more independent board, a Big N auditor, merger and acquisition activity, and lower financial reporting quality are more likely to form a RMC. Overall, our tests of risk outcomes and profitability do not provide consistent evidence of RMC formation being a substantive practice that results in operational and performance improvements. In contrast, our results are more consistent with RMCs fulfilling symbolic roles as an implication of institutional theory which focuses primarily on the perception of responsible risk management actions.

After receiving debt financing, a limited-liability firm chooses between two projects. The safe project results in higher expected cash flows. The excessively risky project results in lower expected debt repayments because default occurs more often. In equilibrium, the creditor anticipates the risk choice of the firm and sets the debt repayment to obtain its required rate of return. The implicit bailout subsidy allows the creditor to lower the debt service payment. As a result, the incremental default benefit of the risky project is lower, leading to less risk-taking.

These expectations emanate from stock exchanges, regulators, credit rating agencies and other key stakeholders. Proponents of enhanced risk oversight argue that an increased understanding of enterprise-wide risks provides strategic benefit by helping the board and management identify and manage risks that may impact the achievement of strategic objectives while at the same time helping the board monitor the extent of risk-taking on the part of management in their desire to meet these objectives. In response to these growing expectations, some boards have asked management to explore implementation of a more holistic, top-down approach to risk oversight widely known as enterprise risk management (ERM) while others have not. Institutional theory would suggest that a number of organizations implement minimal elements of ERM for symbolic reasons, lacking substance in risk oversight. In contrast, agency theory would suggest that boards embrace explicit and robust risk oversight activities to monitor management's risk-taking actions, and resource dependence theory would suggest that they also do so to help the organization achieve strategic objectives. Little is known about the way in which boards and management organize their processes and the impact of those processes on the level of ERM adoption. More importantly, little is known about the extent to which ERM is perceived to provide strategic benefit to those organizations that have invested in developing a robust ERM process.

Furthermore, we measure the subsequent impact of this relationship on future operating performance of firms. As in previous research, our study also finds empirical evidence suggesting that higher network activity of executive directors conveys to larger compensation figures. This excess pay has an impact on future operating performance. Our data set of Spanish listed companies, with high average ownership concentration, show that the network related higher compensation for firms with dispersed ownership leads to subsequent negative operating performance.The implications for executive directors are that networking leads to higher compensation. For dispersed ownership firms, the consequence is that promoting executive networking could be harmful unless other corporate governance mechanisms prevent this outcome. For concentrated ownership firms, this structure allows to capture increases in operating performance. Finally, policy recommendations on corporate governance regulation are that self-regulation is better than imposing the same limit on the number of directorships to all firms if an effective control mechanism operates. Our results suggest that the presence of controlling owners is a strong corporate governance mechanism. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Crespí-Cladera, R.; Departament d'Economia de l'Empresa, Universitat de les Illes Balears, Campus Cra.

We observe that Level 3 fair value estimates are typically priced lower than Level 1 and Level 2 fair value estimates between 2008 and 2011. However, the difference between the pricing of the different estimates reduces over time, suggesting that as market conditions stabilize in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, reliability concerns about Level 3 estimates dissipated to some extent. Next, we examine whether Level 3 gains affect the pricing of Level 3 estimates because managers have discretion to use Level 3 gains to manage earnings and asset values upwards. We find that differences in Level 3 gains do not lead investors to price Level 3 estimates differently.

However, few studies have examined the audit fee within the context of a specific industry, particularly a regulated industry such as insurance. This paper presents an endogenous switching model derived from a sample of 2993 US property-liability firm-years for insurers filing required Annual Statements in years 2006 and 2007. A first-stage auditor choice regression (Big 4 versus Non-Big 4) is followed by a second-stage model of the audit fee, with separate equations for Big 4 and Non-Big 4 clients. The results indicate that both choice and the fee depend on industry-specific client characteristics. Insurance-related measures of risk and complexity are associated with the choice of a large auditor, while opportunistic behavior and owner-manager incentive conflicts are associated with the choice of a smaller auditor. Insurers that resemble typical Big 4 clients are subject to a large-auditor premium, while those that resemble typical Non-Big 4 clients are subject to a Non-Big 4 auditor premium. Auditors profit from their pricing strategies, since the main drivers of the Big 4 premium (the Non-Big 4 premium) are the factors that led the insurer to choose the large auditor (the smaller auditor) in the first place. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Hsu, W.-Y.; Department of Risk Management and Insurance, Feng Chia University, 100, Wenhwa Road, Taiwan",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

This result is consistent with the notion that debt investors are greater consumers of financial statement information.

We observe significant variation in content both within and between the two countries. U.S. firms with higher analyst following tend to create more transparent financial information environments and provide disclosures that are complementary to analysts' analyses through their corporate websites. They also tend to provide easier access to investor relations (IR) services if analyst coverage is light or nonexistent. However, neither effect is true in Taiwan where the securities analysis industry is less mature. Individual investors have greater ownership share in U.S. firms with more information about IR services on their websites; however, their ownership share drops as financial disclosure on the firm's website increases, consistent with institutions diluting individual ownership in firms with more transparency in financial reporting. In Taiwan, however, institutions dilute individual ownership share in firms with less financial information and more trading information on their websites. These results are consistent with Barber et al.'s (2009) findings that institutions find Taiwan firms that attract the aggressive, speculative trading of individuals to be extremely profitable investments. Website disclosures in both countries have some effect on the stock-price response to mandatory earnings releases, but their impact is greater in the U.S. Our findings indicate that website disclosures contribute to the information environment and are related to the degree of interest in the firm by sophisticated market participants.

The results suggest that mandatory IFRS adoption had no significant impact on either real or accrual-based earnings management practices. Additional analysis on a sub-sample of firms with relatively strong earnings management incentives supports a dominant role for firm-level reporting incentives over accounting standards in shaping financial reporting quality. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Doukakis, L.C.; HEC Lausanne, Switzerland; email: leonidas.doukakis@unil.ch",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

There are two outcomes of analyst coverage studies: curbing and stimulating earnings management. However, recent studies (such as Yu, 2008) only provide evidence supporting the curbing side. Given the fact that the data of these studies focus on developed markets and the finding of Rodríguez-Pérez and Hemmen (2010) that external governance mechanisms may stimulate earnings management in an opaque information environment, we conjecture whether stimulating side would be dominant in emerging markets. China offers a valuable setting for us to test the question. Using the data of China capital market from 2003 to 2009, we find that analyst coverage stimulates earnings management through above-the-line items (ALIs) where earnings management cannot be easily detected, and curbs earnings management through below-the-line items (BLIs) where earnings management can be easily detected. We also find that the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in China does create many new opportunities for managers' earnings management but does not significantly improve the monitoring effect of analyst coverage. We only find that compared to those without analyst coverage, firms with analyst coverage have a lower level of earnings management through BLIs after IFRS adoption. These findings suggest that information opacity may weaken the monitoring effect of external corporate governance mechanisms and high quality accounting standards in the literal sense may not enhance the monitoring effect of external corporate governance mechanisms if it is not compatible with the market's institutional environment. In addition, we find that firms with earnings meeting the benchmark have a lower level of earnings management, which indicates that bright-line accounting based rules used in emerging capital markets may constrain the managers' behavior. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Lin, T.W.; Leventhal School of Accounting, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089-0441, United States; email: wtlin@marshall.usc.edu",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

We also find that firms that disclose internal control problems have less analyst coverage and that analyst following declines after the material weakness in internal control is disclosed. The results are robust to controlling for potential self-selection bias and management earnings guidance. Our study documents the consequences of ineffective internal control for an important class of financial statement users and suggests the required reporting on the effectiveness of internal control is beneficial to understanding the properties of analysts' forecasts. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Skaife, H.A.; University of California, Davis, United States; email: haskaife@ucdavis.edu",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

We investigate investor and creditor reactions to policymaker deliberations, recommendations and decisions about FVA and impairment rules in the banking industry. If FVA was a key contributor to the financial crisis as some industry pundits and academic research suggest, we first should observe positive stock market reactions to proposals that relax FVA rules and negative reactions when policymakers support FVA. Second, we investigate cross-sectional stock price reactions to bank-specific factors that potentially contributed to pro-cyclical contagion. Third, we examine whether banks that have fewer alternative sources of information about fair values experience relatively negative reactions to potential relaxation of FVA and impairment rules. Finally, we investigate credit market reactions to these policy deliberations, recommendations and decisions by examining changes in credit default swap spreads for a subset of banks in our sample.Our first result suggests that investors acted as if the potential negative effects of then-existing FVA and impairment rules outweighed any benefits associated with having more timely and transparent mark-to-market data for decision-making. Second, while our cross-sectional test results are mixed, our most robust result suggests that the magnitude of stock price reactions to the relaxation of FVA and impairment rules was positively related to the proportion of banks' illiquid assets. Third, we provide mixed evidence that banks without analyst coverage (and thus presumably fewer alternative sources about fair values) were harmed by proposals and policies that relaxed FVA and impairment rules.

This study examines the relation between audit fee cuts and banks' financial reporting quality. Specifically, we focus on earnings management via loan loss provisions (LLP), the relation between current period LLP and future loan charge-offs, i.e., LLP validity, and the timely recognition of loan losses. For banks audited by Big 4 auditors, we find that income-increasing abnormal LLP are decreasing in audit fee cuts and LLP validity is increasing in audit fee cuts. For banks audited by non-Big 4 auditors, LLP validity is higher for banks that received a fee cut of more than 25% relative to other banks audited by non-Big 4 auditors. We do not observe an association between timely loan loss recognition and cuts in audit fees except for banks audited by non-Big 4 auditors and exempt from internal control audits where a fee cut of more than 25% is associated with less timely loan loss recognition. Overall, the findings suggest that Big 4 auditors constrained earnings management via LLP in banks that received cuts in audit fees.

We find that interlocks by directors on the compensation committee with other companies with clawbacks increase the probability of a clawback. In addition, not all clawbacks are the same. We find that companies with clawbacks that are patterned after SOX are most common and are associated with monitoring-oriented governance and interlocks.

We find that the broader scope of the rule under SFAS 144 results in more persistent continuing income among firms reporting discontinued operations, and that this is concentrated among single-segment firms, which previously were less likely to fall within the scope of APB 30.

Although prior studies examine changes in accounting quality under SOX Sections 302 and 404, there is scant evidence of the accounting quality effects of ICRM reform in foreign jurisdictions. Such evidence is warranted given the ongoing global policy debate of ICRM reform in the post-SOX era. We extend existing research by examining changes in earnings quality following the 1998 German legislation on control and transparency (KTG). The KTG regime provides a unique setting in which the regulatory scope extends beyond internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) to include broad business and enterprise risk control. Using both a differences and difference-in-differences research design, we find that German firms experience an increase in timely loss recognition and a decrease in earnings smoothing after KTG. We also find some evidence of a decrease in loss avoidance behavior. Additional analyses show that the sensitivity of capital investment efficiency to earnings quality increases in the German market after KTG, suggesting that earnings quality effects of mandatory ICRM reform has positive consequences for capital resource allocation. Together, our results are consistent with the achievement of one of the intended outcomes of ICRM regulation-increased accounting quality through effective ICRM systems. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Brown, N.C.; School of Accountancy, 35 Broad Street, RCB 535, Atlanta, GA 30303, United States; email: nbrown@gsu.edu",,,02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

This paper formulates such a framework using management accounting concepts. We demonstrate that the benefits of pursuing sustainability objectives can be decomposed into three parts. The first consists of what might be considered a natural outcome of pursuing the traditional economic goal of efficiency through cost-minimization (a ""waste"" variance). The second part consists of sustainability gains that produce societal benefit but may be incongruent with short-term economic goals (a ""sustainability"" variance). The third part stems from a change in optimal output level when that is considered endogenous to the firm (a ""volume"" variance). While elimination of waste variances can be encouraged using a traditional performance evaluation and reward structure, elimination of sustainability and volume variances requires redesign of performance evaluation tools and reward structures. We demonstrate that failure to recognize and incorporate the difference between the three variances can lead to inefficient allocation of resources, over- or under-production, and only partial fulfillment of environmental goals. Further, availability of shadow price information is essential to implementing such a performance measurement system; thus it is a public policy imperative to develop markets that establish such prices. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Lawson, R.A.; Institute of Management Accountants, Montvale, NJ 07645, United States; email: rlawson@imanet.org",,,02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

Furthermore, using the accrual-based earnings management and meet/beat analyst forecast models we find that the opportunistic financial reporting effect of equity incentives dominates the incentive alignments effect for firms with low monitoring intensity. Using proxies for real earnings management, we find that the incentive alignment effect dominates the opportunistic financial reporting effect for high and moderate monitoring intensity firms. However, for low monitoring intensity firms the opportunistic reporting effect mitigates, but does not completely offset, the benefits of the incentive alignment effect.

One argument in support of this contention is that accounting restatements hurt contracting relations between the firm and outside parties such as a firm's customers and suppliers, negatively impacting firm cash flows. The negative impact on cash flow reduces the level of internal cash holdings available for investment. Another argument is that restatements dampen firm growth by increasing the firm's cost of external financing. We empirically evaluate these arguments by using the standard sales growth based financial planning model. In carrying out our analysis, we distinguish the effects of restatement on overall firm growth as well as its components of internally and externally financed growth. Our findings suggest that overall firm growth rates decline following a restatement. Furthermore, we find that accounting restatements have a greater adverse impact on externally financed growth rates. We also find that not all restatements yield identical effects: the impact of restatements is more pronounced for the subsample of firms identified to have undertaken the more egregious fraudulent reporting than the subsample of firms that reported restatements to correct previous accounting errors. We also find that firms with severe restatements, measured based on announcement period market reactions, have lower externally financed growth.

FAS 150, which changed the reporting requirements, highlights that under the prior rules firms included share-settlement terms in their put contracts to avoid showing their open put position as a balance sheet obligation. However, some evidence suggests that the choice between including cash or share settlement terms may be economically driven by the potential impact that each settlement-type has on firm solvency and equity holdings. Our results support the economic-based motivation for put-type choice by showing that firms elect to include share-settlement terms in their put contracts to provide themselves payment flexibility in the event internally generated cash flows are not sufficient to meet future contractual put obligations.

We argue that board capital, however, may be a more important aspect of board efficacy since directors are the highest level agents of shareholders, meet infrequently, and shareholders have limited recourse for poor decision-making. In contrast, shareholders and the SEC can sue/prosecute directors for conflicts of interest or bias. One role of the board involves determining the depth and degree of the firm's financial disclosures. To test the idea that high capital boards seek to provide greater disclosure quality to investors, we manually collect data on director attributes and apply factor analysis to measure the networking, educational, and experience capital of the board. The results indicate that board capital is positively related to disclosure quality, with differing key attributes for inside and outside directors.

Adopted in 2003, FIN 46 requires financial statement recognition of many previously off-balance sheet structures, including synthetic leases. Synthetic leases are hybrid financing structures that, prior to FIN 46, allowed firms to maximize the benefits of asset ownership for tax purposes while retaining operating lease treatment within the firm's financial statements. We identify a sample of 125 synthetic leasing firms impacted by FIN 46. Utilizing methodology consistent with Dhaliwal et al. (2011), we constructively capitalize these lease liabilities in the period preceding FIN 46 and compare market valuation of these liabilities with capitalized leases after adoption of the standard. We find that the market places greater weight on synthetic lease obligations recognized within the body of the financial statements than it does liabilities disclosed within the associated notes. Finally, we rely on econometric procedures developed in Barth (1991) and extended in Choi et al. (1997) to examine whether the differential market valuation of lease liabilities post FIN 46 is due in part to perceived differences in measurement reliability. The results indicate there is a post FIN 46 reliability effect for all lease liabilities examined. However, while the synthetic lease amounts are the most unreliable examined, they also experience the greatest increase in reliability post FIN 46, indicating that perceived measurement reliability explains in part differential market valuation associated with FIN 46. Our findings have the potential to inform the ongoing standard setting debate surrounding the possible capitalization of all leases.

Firms with more severe agency problems are prone to experiencing independent directors saying 'no'. Independent directors are also more likely to say 'no' when they have multiple directorships, longer tenure, financial expertise, or live in places other than where the firms they serve are located. Consequently, firms with independent directors who say 'no' tend to experience cuts in inter-corporate lending, a lower propensity to pay dividends, reduced bank loans, and greater turnover of top executives. In addition, these firms are more likely to receive a modified audit opinion, obtain 'special treatment', or be subject to regulatory enforcement action in the year after independent directors say 'no'.

It also examines whether the forward-looking statements that are driven by governance are informative about future earnings. This analysis is drawn from a large-scale sample of UK FTSE All-Share companies for financial years ending within the period January 1996-December 2007. We find that corporate governance influences companies' decisions to voluntarily disclose these statements. The main drivers are directors' ownership, board size, board composition, and the duality of the CEO's role. These results suggest that better corporate governance improves reporting practice. We further find that the forward-looking statements of well governed firms improve the stock market's ability to anticipate future earnings. Our findings have important implications for policy makers and regulators because they confirm that the effectiveness of corporate governance in the practice of disclosure is a function of certain characteristics and that the voluntary forward-looking statements of well governed firms contain value relevant information for investors. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Hussainey, K.; Department of Accounting and Auditing, , Cairo, Egypt; email: khaled.hussainey@plymouth.ac.uk",,,02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

The inspections program is the central feature of the PCAOB. We examine whether PCAOB inspections are able to distinguish actual audit quality (as opposed to perceived) during the period inspected to better understand this important regulatory tool. We use three measures that proxy for actual audit quality: abnormal accruals, restatements, and the propensity to issue a going concern opinion. For triennially inspected auditors, we find that PCAOB inspections are associated with lower audit quality when the reports are seriously deficient (weaker results for deficient reports). More specifically, we find clients of triennially inspected auditors that receive a deficient or seriously deficient report are associated with significantly higher abnormal current accruals and clients of auditors that receive a seriously deficient report are associated with a greater propensity to restate. Our evidence is subject to the caveat that PCAOB reports for triennially inspected auditors do not capture the going concern aspect of audit quality. For annually inspected auditors, the results are conflicting and suggest PCAOB inspection reports do not distinguish audit quality during the period inspected for annually inspected auditors. © 2012.",,,"Gunny, K.A.; University of Colorado, Boulder, 419 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309, United States; email: katherine.gunny@colorado.edu",,,02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

These rules limit management influence over auditors by mandating that SASAC assign auditors for CSOEs and by requiring management to retain auditors for at least 2. years and at most 5. years. Since these rules apply only to CSOEs, we use a difference-in-difference design to study the impact of these regulations on audit quality.

Using a sample of 127 firms over a 6-year period (2000-2005), we empirically test characteristics of governance and media in relation to VED. Our results suggest that VED quality is positively associated with environmental media coverage, negative environmental media and board attributes of independence, diversity, and expertise.

Although there is an extensive literature on managers' disclosure of earnings forecasts, there is a paucity of research on how auditors incorporate information from these voluntary disclosures. We find that the issuance of an annual or quarterly management earnings forecast in the prior period is positively associated with the current period audit fees. Our results indicate that on average, audit fees are higher by about 7% for firm-years associated with an annual forecast. Among the firms that issue earnings forecasts, we find no association between audit fees and likelihood of updating a previously issued earnings forecast, indicating that auditors do not view such behavior negatively. Further, we find audit fees to be positively associated with the error and the bias (or optimism) in the forecasts for annual forecasts but not for quarterly forecasts.

We predict that motor carriers were likely to use income-decreasing earnings management to lessen the public perception of excessive industry profits and thus to avoid deregulation that during this period of heightened political cost.We test this hypothesis on a sample of publicly-traded, federally-regulated motor carriers using Dechow et al.'s (1995) accruals model, augmented as a fixed-effects model (Key, 1997; Han and Wang, 1998) with separate controls for performance (Kothari et al., 2005) and for measurement error caused by mergers, acquisitions and discontinued operations (Hansen, 1999; Collins and Hribar, 2002). We compare accruals during the political-cost deregulation period of 1975-1979 against benchmark periods before and after industry deregulation.For all benchmark periods, we find evidence that motor-carrier firms managed earnings to reduce reported income in the later years of the deregulation period. This is the period when federal efforts shifted from administrative decisions that eased entry barriers and derailed collusive price setting to legislative efforts to deregulate the industry.

While any number of case contexts would allow us to contrast and compare judges and jurors, we chose one that we believed would also address a second timely issue, auditor reliance or non-reliance upon the work of others. Within the general context of litigation of an alleged audit failure, we manipulated, between-participants, external auditor reliance on the work of others (relied on outsourced work, relied on in-house internal auditors' work or did not rely). Our results show differences in the liability assessments of judges and jurors. Judges assign more liability to auditors that rely on the work of in-house internal auditors, less liability to auditors that rely on outsourced internal auditors and the least liability to auditors that choose not to rely on the work of internal auditors (but re-perform the work themselves) while jurors assess higher liability regardless of the work done by the auditors. Mediation analyses suggests the differences found in the overall liability assessments of jurors and judges are partially driven by their divergent attitudes towards the public accounting profession with jurors' unfavorable attitudes leading to them assign liability regardless of the work performed. Further analysis suggests juror insensitivity to our reliance manipulations may reflect a strict liability perspective (consistent with prior work by Charron and Lowe (2008)); while judges consider other factors when making liability assessments. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Arel, B.; School of Business Administration, 307 Kalkin Hall, Burlington, VT 05405, United States; email: barel@bsad.uvm.edu",,,02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

Some researchers contend that equity holdings motivate audit committees to minimize the risk of reporting problems, while others believe equity holdings align the committees' incentives with management. To reconcile these seemingly contradictory positions, I hypothesize that the influence of audit committee equity holdings depends upon the risk of reporting problems. I contend that when the risk of reporting problems is low (high) equity holdings motivate audit committees to give managers greater (less) discretion over reporting policies because the expected benefits from giving the discretion is greater (less) than the expected cost of the reporting problems that might occur from giving the discretion. I test whether the influence of audit committee equity holdings varies with the risk of reporting problems using a sample of 1370 firm-observations with earnings near the prior year's earning level and a sample of 2389 firm-observations near analyst forecasts. I find the influence of audit committee equity holdings on the likelihood that a firm meets the prior year's earnings level varies with the CEO's equity incentives and the level of high-risk assets. I also find the influence of audit committee equity holdings on the likelihood that a firm meets analysts' forecast varies with the CEO's equity incentives and the effectiveness of internal controls.

We empirically investigate the extent to which US firms identified by the SEC in their Enforcement Releases demonstrate higher levels of conditional conservatism in order to mitigate information asymmetry and agency problems. Specifically, by assessing the timing of changes in the litigation risk environment for fraud firms, we document how differences in heightened legal liability guide changes in conservative accounting behavior. Compared to a matched non-fraud control sample, we document that fraud firms have significantly lower levels of accounting conservatism in the pre-fraud period. Consistent with changes in potential legal liability, we find an increase in accounting conservatism for fraud firms during the SEC investigation period. Subsequently, during the public discovery of fraud, any increases in accounting conservatism are marginal and appear to converge back to lower levels compared to the SEC investigation period. Overall, our findings suggest more temporary changes in conservative reporting in the short-term for fraud firms. We also document that increased levels of accounting conservatism for fraud firms are not due solely to the passage of the SOX Act. Our findings aid in explaining fraud firms' incentives and opportunities for accounting conservatism and lend support for why standard setters, regulators and auditors should continue to monitor and re-evaluate conservatism's short-term effects that are conditioned on changes in a firm's risk environment. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Alam, P.; Department of Accounting, P.O.

The rules are either silent on whether or when a partner can rotate back or else they specify a cooling-off period after which the rotated-off partner can resume the audit. Using archival data from China, a country with a 2-year cooling-off period, this paper explores the determinants of whether the audit partner rotates back or not when the cooling-off period expires, and whether audit quality is weakened by the audit partner rotation-back practice. We find that the audit partner rotation-back practice can be explained by factors relating to switching costs, agency conflicts, client desirability, and the audit partner's capacity constraint considerations. Interestingly, we find that clients suffering greater audit adjustments immediately prior to the expiration of the cooling-off period are more likely to be associated with subsequent audit partner rotation-back. Furthermore, we find that rotation-back partners tend to treat former clients more favorably than non-rotation-back cases using modified audit opinions as our proxy for audit quality. Overall, our findings offer preliminary explanations for and shed light on the consequences of rotation-back practice arising from mandatory audit partner rotation requirements and lend support to regulatory concerns on rotation-back practice among audit partners. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Firth, M.A.; Department of Finance and Insurance, Hong Kong; email: mafirth@ln.edu.hk",,,02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

Vertical equity has two elements: progressivity and income equality. In this paper, we analyze the vertical equity effects of the US income tax system during 1995-2006 and show that income inequality increased substantially during the period combined with a significant reduction in real progressivity.Using a Lorenz-curve-based graphical method, we decompose progressivity and income inequality indices and identify and quantify how much each source of income contributes to overall progressivity and income inequality. Results for the 1995-2006 period indicate that US income tax treatment of Salaries and Wages income were distributed and taxed progressively and contributed to a decrease in income inequality. However, the treatment of Net Capital Gains not only decreased progressivity, it negated the income inequality reduction achieved by salaries and wages.These results show that to evaluate the vertical equity of a tax system, both income inequality and progressivity indexes must be considered. Additionally, the decomposition method allows policy makers to estimate the progressivity and income inequality effects of marginal changes in income source and how each source is taxed. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Iyer, G.S.; Department of Accounting, , Denton, TX 76201, United States; email: govind.iyer@unt.edu",,,02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

Because the Department of Defense found evidence of a shrinking defense industrial base in the early 1970s, it wanted to encourage capital spending by defense firms. The result was a cost accounting standard that reimbursed contractors for an imputed facilities capital cost of money (FCCOM) that has remained in effect, virtually unchanged, for almost 30. years, despite structural changes in the defense industry. Our results, using a sample of 628 defense firms, suggest that the standard met its intended objective of increased capital spending within 10. years of its promulgation. However, we also find that the FCCOM subsidy may have contributed to a decreased cost of debt within the defense sector over the long-term. Finally, further analyses indicate that the long-term persistence of this subsidy may have encouraged defense contractors to overinvest in capital goods.

This study examines the effects of this regulatory change on the effort and reporting decisions of audit partners. We show that partners in an audit firm strategically change the firm's liability-sharing rule. As a consequence, the regulation restores truthful reporting but has an undesirable negative effect on audit effort. The effect of the regulation on the welfare of the economy (defined as the total payoff to both audit firms and their clients) hinges on the tradeoff between the benefit of the regulation, which is derived from the inducement of truthful reporting, and the cost of the regulation, which results from less diligent audit work. We show that the regulation is more likely to increase the welfare in a strong legal regime (where the legal liability cost of auditor litigation is high) than in a weak legal regime. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Liu, X.; School of Business, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong; email: acliu@hku.hk",,,02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

Prior research suggests that the subjectivity in SFAS No. 143 provides management with the opportunity to manage earnings and avoid the recognition of CAROs. This study examines firms that recorded adjustments for CAROs upon FIN 47 adoption. We demonstrate that effective monitoring is essential to promote adherence with principles-based standards, and that gatekeepers may not be effective when standards are ambiguous. Univariate tests and logistic regressions reveal that FIN 47 adopters have audit committees with a greater number of financial experts and are audited by BIG 4 firms. Particular firm-specific factors are also found to be associated with the adoption decision. The results also indicate that newly-reported obligations related to asbestos in firm-owned property and restoration costs for leased premises were subject to prior management discretion. This study extends existing literature on SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47 and studies examining earnings management with principles-based standards. The case of FIN 47 provides further evidence that significant opportunities for earnings management and discretion exist within a principles-based accounting environment, particularly when standards lack clarity.

Given this unusually charged tax reform season, populist and party rhetoric appears to the general population to have largely replaced reasoned debate as politicians, economists and pundits "" cherry pick"" facts to justify their claims. Our contribution to the current debate on tax equity is that this is one of the very few studies that jointly consider the impact of payroll . and income taxes. Most tax equity studies focus only on the federal income tax and as such issue misleading implications. It is important to jointly consider payroll and income taxes because (a) for taxpayers in lower income ranges, the payroll tax burden outweighs the income tax burden, while (b) for higher income taxpayers income from wages above $106,800 ($110,000 in 2012) are payroll-tax free, and (c) other sources of income, namely dividends and capital gains, are not subject to payroll taxes at all. Thus, we provide a more comprehensive picture of the overall progressivity (or lack thereof) exhibited by the current tax laws. In addition, we also consider how some often-raised tax proposals would prospectively affect income inequality and tax progressivity. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Iyer, G.S.; Department of Accounting, , Denton, TX 76201, United States; email: govind.iyer@unt.edu",,,02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

We posit FD's prohibition on private manager-analyst communication reduces (increases) optimism (pessimism) in management earnings forecasts. Prior to FD, managers could avoid publicly retracting prior optimistic forecasts by privately communicating with analysts, who could lower investor expectations with a new analyst forecast. After FD, managers with optimistic forecasts must either publicly admit their optimism by issuing a new management forecast or they must negatively surprise investors at the earnings announcement. Further, FD forces managers to use public forecasts instead of private communications to establish beatable expectations. Our evidence suggests FD reduced optimism in management forecasts. This reduction in optimistic bias is not offset by an increase in pessimistic bias. Consistent with this, we further find post-FD improvements in forecast accuracy and informativeness.

Analysis of the data using an ordinary least squares (OLSs) approach provides evidence that adoption of IFRS leads to increased FDI inflows. The analysis indicates, however, that the overall increase in FDI inflows from IFRS adoption is due to the increase in FDI inflows by countries with developing, as opposed to developed, economies. A difference-in-difference test confirms these findings. A key potential driver for IFRS adoption by countries with developing economies is the desire to receive financial aid from the World Bank. This factor is explicitly taken into account using a two-stage instrumental variable (IV) model. The results using the IV model provide strong confirmation of the OLS results. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Loeb, M.P.; Accounting and Information Assurance, United States; email: mloeb@rhsmith.umd.edu",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

A total of 71 corporate directors participated in an experiment that included a within-participant treatment (shareholders' perception of risk was the same as or higher than the director's estimate of probable risk) and two between-participant treatments (director's upcoming reelection risk was low or high; board meeting discussion transparency was low or high). When shareholders' perceived risk and directors' estimate of probable risk were the same, support for the initiative was relatively low across the reelection risk and discussion transparency treatments. When shareholders' perceived risk was higher than probable risk, a significant interaction term indicates that support for the initiative was (1) low when reelection risk was low, irrespective of discussion transparency, (2) moderate when reelection risk and discussion transparency were high, and (3) high when reelection risk was high and discussion transparency was low. We provide evidence of a potential threat to effective enterprise risk management and director objectivity that has not previously been investigated and evaluate a method for mitigating this threat. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Rose, J.M.; Victoria University of Wellington, Rutherford House, Thorndon, Wellington 6011, New Zealand; email: Jake.Rose@unh.edu",,"Elsevier Inc.",02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

Using pension related data for 233 local governments in Michigan and Pennsylvania, we examine whether local governments follow the disclosure requirements under GASBS No. 27, and the factors that explain a government's propensity to include these items. Our descriptive statistics suggest that a significant number of governments with sole-employer defined benefit pension plans are not complying with these requirements. Our regression results suggest that the GFOA Certificate of Achievement Program, debt, state oversight, and appointed officials impact a government's propensity to follow the disclosure requirements of GASBS No. 27. Our findings also suggest that pension plans that are under-funded are less likely to include these disclosures and disclosure quality is lower for disclosures in required supplementary information compared to those in the financial statement notes. Elgin et al. (2010) noted that unfunded retirement benefits have become an election issue, and unions are fighting back. As the importance of this issue intensifies, it is critical that interested parties have a complete set of facts to make informed decisions.

We expect that earnings management would increase after deregulation, since industry deregulation generally increases managerial discretion, whereas internal corporate governance systems are sluggish in adapting to newly changed environments. As corporate governance structures become more effective in tempering highly discretionary managers, and as capital markets learn more about how to design better management incentive systems, managers' incentives and capacity to engage in earnings management will diminish. Based on industry data, we find that the magnitude of absolute values of discretionary accruals increase significantly in the post-deregulation period.

However, the increased level of earnings management then decreased to return close to the level seen during the regulation period.

We find no relationship between decreases in states' real corporate income tax revenues and their adoption of anti-PIC statutes, but do find that proposals are more common in states with slower growth in real personal income. This study contributes to existing state and local tax policy research by demonstrating that certain types of policy decisions may arise from reasons closely linked to herding behavior. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Robb, S.W.G.; Kenneth G.

We find evidence of close alignment of a firm's earnings management propensity and its use of tactical causal disclosures. Stronger earnings management is associated with more intense assertive causal disclosure. On the other hand, firms exhibiting stronger earnings management tend to avoid the use of explicit defensive causal disclosure tactics. These findings are consistent with the strong background expectations of managerial agency and control that pervade an IPO setting.

Accruals quality, which measures the precision with which accruals predict future cash flows, has two potential opposing effects on the noise in earnings as a measure of managerial performance. Specifically, higher quality accruals should decrease the deviations of earnings from future cash flows and increase the sensitivity of earnings to cash flows that are not attributable to managerial actions. My evidence indicates that better accruals quality is associated with a higher weight on earnings in compensation contracts, which suggests that accruals quality overall reduces the noise in earnings. I also find that the positive association between accruals quality and the weight on earnings is mainly driven by innate accruals quality rather than discretionary accruals quality. Therefore, accrual errors resulting from the volatility of the operating environment are a primary source of noise in earnings considered by compensation committees. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Peng, E.Y.; Fordham University, 1790 Broadway, 13th FL, New York, NY 10019, United States; email: ypeng@fordham.edu",,,02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

The agency conflict between minority and controlling shareholders can impede a government from privatizing by selling its stake to diffuse investors in the public capital market with a share-issue privatization (SIP) that typically generates important spillover economic benefits, rather than an asset sale to a small group of buyers. However, prior research implies that accounting transparency plays a natural role in preventing controlling shareholders from siphoning corporate resources by helping minority investors identify any diversionary practices. After controlling for firm-level and other country-level characteristics, we find that SIPs become more likely when countries mandate strict disclosure standards, although this result is sensitive to model specification. In comparison, we provide strong, robust evidence that SIPs are more likely in jurisdictions that relax the burden of proof in civil lawsuits and criminal prosecutions against auditors, leading to more credible financial statements.

Both agents report the result of their work, the auditor acting first. Both use an imperfect technology that results in a privately observed signal regarding the quality of financial statements. The audit committee as well as the auditor are anxious to build up reputation in the labor market. Given this predominant goal they report on the signal in order to maximize the market's assessment of their ability. At the end of the game the true character of the financial statements is revealed to the public with some positive probability. The market uses this information along with the agents' reports to update beliefs about the agents' abilities.

The analysis establishes that bounded rationality and the ethical compass play an important role in the managers' decisions. As such, the study provides an insight into why managers would engage in schemes that could potentially ruin their lives. The analysis also demonstrates that earnings management has multi-period dynamic properties, while the effort and insider trading decisions are made independently each period. Another interesting finding is that that earnings manipulation can only occur in a world with ethically diverse managers. Contrary to common wisdom, the study shows that shareholders have a vested interest in eliciting income management because it boosts their wealth. Consequently, expected market losses to shareholders' value, in response to detected accounting manipulations, are necessary to mitigate shareholders' preferences for earnings management. It is interesting to note that shareholders' preferences for earnings management (balanced by the expected market losses) imply that they would not necessarily prefer to hire the most ethical and least 'bounded rationality' decision-making managers.

Specifically, the SEC has argued that some compensation packages provide incentives for risk-taking that may undermine shareholder value over the long-term. Short-term incentive payments to executives in the form of cash bonuses are mostly contingent on reaching targets of accounting-related measures or financial performance measures (FPMs). However, the incentives from these payments may lead to accrual manipulation and earnings management (EM). Alternative measures are non-financial performance measures (NFPMs). We expect that firms that employ NFPMs in bonus contracts will have a lower prevalence of EM, since these measures tend to focus executives on the long-term. In this paper, we examine the type of performance measures used by firms in the S&P 500 index in their cash bonus compensation. We find that firms that use both FPMs and NFPMs have lower discretionary accruals compared to firms that use only FPMs, consistent with lower income-increasing EM. However, we do not find evidence of a reduction in EM behavior using the incidence of meeting or just beating analyst earnings benchmarks, another common EM proxy. In additional tests on a subset of firms with equity offerings, in which incentives for income-increasing manipulation are likely high, we find that firms with NFPMs have lower discretionary accruals. The implication is that NFPMs can be used in compensation contracts to reduce EM behavior and mitigate erroneous executive compensation.

This paper examines the accounting dimension of reforms designed to achieve enhanced administrative efficiency and greater economy in the operation of government departments. A growing interest in the role of accounting within British government during the second quarter of the nineteenth century is elucidated, and prevailing ideas concerning how accounting within government departments and accountability from the executive to parliament might be performed more efficiently and effectively are uncovered. The battle between divergent pressure groups concerning who should possess jurisdiction over accounting work is explored, and the solution to this problematic is found to connect with the nature of a central government accounting system that was itself undergoing significant change. Consistency between the Northcote-Trevelyan recommendations and ongoing internal initiatives designed to ensure the competence of clerks recruited to undertake accounting work and subsequently applying for promotion to a higher grade is demonstrated. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Edwards, J.R.; Cardiff Business School, Colum Drive, Cardiff, CF10 3EU, United Kingdom; email: edwardsjr@cardiff.ac.uk",,,02784254,,JACPD,,"English","J.

Focusing on a French setting where managers can choose to capitalize R&D expenditures under certain circumstances, we find that, after controlling for industry effects, firms that capitalize R&D expenditures spend less on R&D, have more volatile R&D efforts, and are smaller and more leveraged than firms that expense R&D expenditures. We also find that capitalizers capitalize R&D outlays when they need to meet or beat thresholds. Finally, we show that the decision to capitalize R&D is generally associated with a negative or neutral impact on future performance, even after controlling for self-selection. Our results also show that when firms both capitalize and expense R&D expenditures, the expensed portion exhibits a stronger (and negative) relationship with future performance. Market-based tests corroborate these findings. While we cannot unambiguously establish whether our findings imply that management uses R&D capitalization to manage earnings or because it is unable to estimate the earning power of R&D projects, our results suggest that management is unable to truthfully convey information about future performance through its decision to capitalize R&D.

Using samples comprised of 58,832 firm-year observations drawn from 33 countries from 2002 through 2008, we find that positive earnings reported under IFRS are no more or less persistent than earnings reported under U.S. GAAP but losses reported under IFRS are less persistent than losses reported under U.S. GAAP. Moreover, we find that earnings reported under IFRS are no more or less persistent and are no more or less associated with future cash flows than earnings reported under non-U.S. DAS. However, we find that earnings reported under U.S. GAAP are more closely associated with future cash flows than earnings reported under IFRS. This is important if a key role of reported earnings is to help investors form expectations about future cash flows.
