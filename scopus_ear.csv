We present an in-depth case study examining how an influential Dutch advocacy organization enacted its engagement with companies to promote the adoption of corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting and management practices. Drawing on the construct of strategic framing, we unpack the characteristics that supported the development of a resonant engagement frame that set the boundaries and expectations around the organization’s engagement with companies. We unveil how several internal organizational deficiencies impeded the quality of these engagements, thereby threatening this frame resonance. The paper extends our understanding of the nature and role of strategic framing in the construction of CSR reporting and advances our limited knowledge of how CSR advocacy organizations’ internal operations impact on their engagement efforts. This allows us to better comprehend how these organizations can set engagement agendas and mobilize support for collaborative CSR change initiatives. © 2020 The Author(s).

We vary the presence of RPI (absent vs. present), the level of peers’ rule-breaking (low vs. high), and the presence of weak formal controls (absent vs. present). We find that in the absence of formal controls, RPI provision increases an employee’s rule-breaking when he/she perceives that his/her peers’ rule-breaking is high but not when his/her peers’ rule-breaking is low. We attribute this finding to the increased importance of the behavior of others when RPI is present. Further, we provide evidence that the presence of weak formal controls increases rule-breaking relative to no controls. We argue that such controls alter employees’ perception of the context and induce a more calculative focus on the economic benefits than the costs, while ethical motivations are crowded out. Finally, we show that ethical considerations triggered by RPI in situations of low levels of peers’ rule-breaking become less important when weak controls are present.

Calculated based on audit fees, our new measure of audit partner workload compression (APWC) is negatively related to accruals quality and the probability of modified audit opinions, while positively associated with the propensity to report small profits and the prospect of audit report delays. Nevertheless, accounting firms and client firms with audit partners facing workload compression are not more likely to receive government sanctions.

Although such consulting provides value to an organization, it can also put the objectivity and independence of internal auditors at risk. We hypothesize that external auditors’ reliance on the internal audit function depends on the effectiveness of the audit committee monitoring the internal auditors’ activities. We also hypothesize that external auditors’ perception of the objectivity and independence of internal auditors mediates the reliance decision. We analyze these hypotheses using a 2 × 2 between-subjects design with 92 certified external auditors. Confirming the hypotheses, we find that external auditors’ reliance on the internal audit function is highest when the latter provides risk management consulting under the supervision of a strong audit committee. It is lower if the internal audit function provides only assurance (under either a weak or strong audit committee) and lowest if it provides consulting under a weak audit committee.

We find that analyst teams with a hierarchy outperform flat teams (teams without a clear hierarchy). Specifically, hierarchical teams issue forecasts with higher accuracy, less optimism bias, less co-movement with the consensus, and stronger investor reactions. The results remain robust after we control for a number of firm and analyst characteristics and fixed effects. Further analysis shows that working in a hierarchical team helps junior analysts improve their individual forecasts for other firms, and senior analysts also benefit from working with junior analysts in hierarchical teams.

This effect influences the optimal design of the management accounting information system and changes the regimes where information acquisition is optimal for the principal.

We document that the demand for similarity by issuers, their advisors and bond investors follows the predictions of sociological and economic theories. Further, consistent with similarity in covenants reducing bond investors’ information acquisition and processing costs, we show that bonds with more similar covenant restrictiveness receive lower yields at issuance. These bonds are also more likely to be held by long-term bond investors, such as insurance companies, and are characterized by greater liquidity in the secondary market, providing a partial explanation for the lower bond yields. Our results highlight the benefits of covenant similarity and suggest that the use of covenants with similar restrictiveness levels brings information acquisition and processing cost savings that may be larger than the monitoring benefits provided by covenants with more tailored features. © 2019 European Accounting Association.","Bond Covenants; Covenant Restrictiveness; Primary Bond Prices; Similarity",,"Vyas, D.; Department of Management — UTM Rotman School of Management, 105 St. George Street, Canada; email: dushyant.vyas@utoronto.ca",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

Current profitability as well as its cash flow and accruals components are much more informative predictors of future profitability than macroeconomic expectations in both non-crisis and crisis periods. Market pricing tests suggest that macroeconomic expectations are not informative and thus not priced by market participants during crisis periods and support efficient pricing of current profitability under both non-crisis and crisis periods. However, it is the cash flow component of profitability that is efficiently priced under both economic conditions, while the accrual component of profitability is mispriced during crisis periods.

Thanks to sophisticated data collection (ethnographic endeavor, interviews with CFEs, and document analysis), we found that the ACFE’s promotional machinery comprises pragmatic, moral, and epistemic claims. Our analysis indicates that pragmatic legitimacy plays a central role in enrolling members as ambassadors of the CFE designation–in spite of the skepticism that they tend to have regarding the association’s moral and epistemic claims. We are therefore confronted with a spread of claims to expertise taking place despite a degree of internal discordance–as if member discomfort with certain aspects of their association’s discourse is immaterial to the construction of the association’s external legitimacy.

A possible interpretation of these findings is a decline in investor disagreement following the rule. We also find that liquidity around current filings of oil and gas firms increased following the disclosure rule. Moreover, some results indicate that differences in unexplained trading volume associated with the characteristics of the filing firm or of the filing itself prior to the rule were moderated after it came into effect. © 2019, © 2019 European Accounting Association.","investor disagreement; liquidity; trading volume; Voluntary disclosure",,"Shust, E.; Efrat Shust, Israel; email: efratshu@openu.ac.il",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

We examine the association between future NAS fees and audit quality by distinguishing among tax, audit-related and other services. We base the analysis on a sample of Spanish listed companies for the period between 2005 and 2016, finding a consistent negative association between future other NAS fees and audit quality. This suggests that the expectation of future purchases of this type of NAS may impair auditor independence. Conversely, for tax and audit-related services results are not significant.

We investigate the model adjustments companies make to their BSM models to deal with these transaction costs. We specifically examine Employee Stock Option (ESO) plans listed on the French stock exchange, as detailed disclosure on modeling is available for these ESOs. Our analysis questions the reliability of these model adjustments, especially their bias and the extent to which they provide a faithful representation of option fair values. Holding parameter values constant, we find that the model adjustments lead to a median understatement of 52% compared to the BSM model price, higher than the discount we observe for the opportunistic determination of model parameters (below 20%). The paper contributes to the fair value literature by highlighting model risk in the fair valuation of options. This model risk stems from assumptions made about the size of transaction costs and complements the notion of parameter risk analyzed in previous literature.

We propose that perceptions of foreign institutions may influence SEC enforcement action and private litigation. We provide evidence that enforcement and litigation threats are negatively related to the strength of legal institutions in the foreign IPO’s country of origin. We find earnings management is more pronounced in foreign IPOs from countries with strong legal institutions. We further explore whether earnings management is priced in the IPO market and find no relation between IPO proceeds and earnings management. Our results are consistent with upward earnings management as in Stein (1989), the magnitude of which is reduced when the anticipated cost of enforcement and litigation is higher.

In doing so, they reduce the statistical power of standard indicators of accrual-based earnings management–in effect, camouflaging their earnings management activity. This proposition is of interest because many influential papers on earnings management have utilized accrual-based indicators to reach their conclusions. Our results indicate that firms indeed became more likely to engage in AC cash management after the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), and that this tendency was particularly pronounced among firms with strong incentives (or enhanced ability) to perform and hide earnings management. In particular, our findings suggest that the post-SOX decrease in standard measurements of accrual-based earnings management, identified in prior research, is partially attributable to firms’ increased engagement in AC cash management activity. © 2019, © 2019 European Accounting Association.","Camouflaged Earnings Management; Cash Management; Earnings Management; Sarbanes-Oxley Act",,"Kama, I.; Coller School of Management, Israel; email: Kamaitay@tauex.tau.ac.il",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

We find that, ceteris paribus, MAO recipients underperform in the future and have a higher incidence of adverse outcomes such as misreporting and stock delisting, and the market reacts negatively to MAOs during the short window around MAO disclosure. Importantly, MAO disclosure is not followed by negative long-term stock returns, suggesting stock price adjustments to MAOs are speedy and unbiased. These findings hold for both GCOs and GAAP/DISC MAOs.

We examine such challenges by means of an in-depth case study of a manufacturing firm that started to monitor sales forecast accuracy. Drawing from interviews, meeting observations and written documentation, we highlight two possible concerns with the use of forecast accuracy: concerns related to the limited degree of controllability of the performance measure and concerns with its goal congruence. We illustrate how organizational actors experienced these challenges and how they adapted their approach to forecast accuracy in response to them. Our empirical observations do not only shed light on the possibilities and challenges pertaining to the use of forecast accuracy as a performance measure; they also improve our understanding of how specific qualities of performance measures apply to ‘truth-inducing’ indicators, and how the particular organizational and market context can shape the quality of performance measures more generally. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

We review 128 studies on the measurement of tax misperception and its behavioral implications. The review reveals that many taxpayers have substantial tax misperceptions that lead to biased decision making. We develop a Behavioral Taxpayer Response Model on the impact of provided tax information on tax perception. Besides individual traits, characteristics of the tax information and the decision environment determine the extent of tax misperception. We discuss opportunities for future research and methodological limitations. While there is much evidence on tax misperception at the individual level, we hardly find any research at the firm level. Little is known about the real effects of managers’ tax misperception and on how tax information is strategically managed to impact stakeholders. This research gap is surprising as a large part of the accounting literature analyzes decision making and disclosure of firms.

Instead, we observe positive shifts in four widely-used proxies for audit quality.

We develop and apply a three-phase model based on prior research and professional guidance (IAASB, 2014), which maps cultural embedding mechanisms (EMs, visible manifestations and organizational conditions to establish culture), perceptions of existing culture, and consequences of culture. Our synthesis shows that the culture of an audit firm is most oriented toward quality if leadership emphasizes professionalism over commercialism, promotes ethical judgments, and facilitates learning through systems, integration of specialists, and interpersonal interactions among auditors. The research cited shows strong influence on AFC of tone at the top set by leadership, as well as incentives in performance/reward systems. Studies we review generally imply continued concern for the influence of commercialism on AFC, but future research should investigate whether recent forces (i.e. pressure from regulators and efforts by the firms) have caused a cultural shift toward professionalism.

I argue that firms with high IO strategically choose to announce earnings after hours to facilitate post-announcement price discovery and reduce volatility because the after-hours period is largely dominated by sophisticated institutional investors. I find that firms with greater IO are more likely to announce earnings during after-market sessions (i.e., after hours after the market closes), but not during premarket sessions (i.e., after hours before the market opens). My analysis further shows that transient IO has a stronger influence on the likelihood of after-market announcements relative to quasi-indexer or dedicated institutional holdings and that firms with high IO are even more likely to announce during after-market sessions when firms have bad earnings news or when earnings include large transitory items. Lastly, I find that announcing earnings during after-market sessions indeed facilitates post-announcement price discovery and reduces volatility for firms with high IO.

However, the literature offers little evidence regarding how auditors perform client inquiry and how note taking during client inquiry is associated with audit quality. We conduct a mixed-methods study to examine these issues. First, we conduct interviews with seven highly-experienced auditors and five staff auditors to understand current practices regarding client inquiries, as well as evaluating and documenting evidence gathered from client inquiries. These interviews provide a thorough description of inquiry, highlighting that auditors routinely take notes during inquiry but can have difficulty with the interrelated, complex cognitive tasks of asking questions, processing client answers, and taking notes during inquiry. Second, we conduct two experiments to examine the impact of note taking during inquiry on skeptical judgments. Results from both experiments indicate that auditors taking note of more ideas during the inquiry is positively associated with memory accuracy. However, this does not improve skeptical judgments, and may lead to less skeptical judgments. Our second experiment indicates a prompt to develop expectations prior to the inquiry improves identification of inconsistencies in the inquiry, leading to more skeptical judgments.

By drawing on empirical materials on responses to unfairness criticisms raised against target-setting practices in a bank, the study shows that such legitimation work also requires responding to equity-related criticisms. Equity implies that, when situations differ, targets must be differentiated to make the intensity of efforts the same. This study shows that legitimately differentiating targets requires an original and highly complex commensuration work. This work is original because compared to prior commensuration studies it concerns the commensuration of efforts and not of entities. This work is complex because it is difficult to account for all differences during target-setting and because such differentiation can be made mechanically and discretionally, each form of differentiation bringing its own source of illegitimacy. Moreover, it is also complex because it is a distributed work, involving numerous actors with multiple concerns. Such commensuration work then appears to be continuous and dynamic. This complements prior studies in target-setting, which have focussed mainly on dyadic relations between a superior and a subordinate and on single-period adjustments to targets. © 2020 European Accounting Association.","Commensuration work; Equity; Fairness; Legitimacy; Target-setting",,"Habran, Y.; Department of Finance, 86, Rue du Sergent Blandan, France; email: yves.habran@icn-artem.com",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

Next, we find evidence that in the post-inspection period audit fees further increase for firms without QCDs, while there is limited evidence for fee increases for firms with remediated QCDs, suggesting changes in audit firm reputation.

We analyze a matched-pair sample of covenant violation firms with non-violation firms that have a similar risk of a covenant violation. We have three main findings. First, our evidence indicates that covenant violations are costly events for shareholders as lenders appear to use their control rights in ways that increase the likelihood of loan repayment but impose costs for shareholders. Second, there is limited evidence indicating covenant-related accrual-earnings management activities impose significant costs on shareholders, but we find shareholders are worse off following unsuccessful real earnings management. Third, our evidence indicates that, on average, shareholders at high violation risk firms are better off when their firms successfully engage in accruals earnings management to avoid a violation compared to shareholders at firms that violate a covenant but do not manage earnings. Thus, covenant-related earnings management may be in the best interests of shareholders and is not necessarily evidence of shareholder-manager agency conflicts. © 2020 European Accounting Association.","Debt covenants violations; Earnings management; Future firm performance",,"Penalva, F.; IESE Business School, Spain; email: penalva@iese.edu",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

Four sets of criticism of the institutional work perspective, pivoting on its emphasis on such work as an institutionally embedded multi-level phenomenon, the intentions behind institutional work, the relationship between habitual and reflexive agency and its conception of power, are identified. Insofar as accounting research using the concept of institutional work has addressed such criticisms, it has mainly been confined to those emerging within institutional theory whilst much less attention has been paid to criticisms raised by critical management scholars who are less sympathetic to institutional theory. Drawing on recent advances in critical sociology, I advance a framework that addresses these criticisms. In doing so, I discuss the possibilities of imbuing research on institutional work with innate concerns with radical social critique and emancipation. This contributes to a refined understanding of institutional work as a source of change and stability and provides a platform for turning institutional accounting research into a politically engaged research program underpinned by critical intent. © 2020 European Accounting Association.","Accounting; Emancipation; Embeddedness; Institutional work; Power; Reflexivity",,"Modell, S.; Sven Modell Alliance Manchester Business School, Booth Street West, United Kingdom; email: Sven.Modell@mbs.ac.uk",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

Securities analysts serve as external monitors, deterring managers from avoiding goodwill impairment recognition, but analysts might also pressure managers, resulting in understated goodwill impairment and inflated earnings. Using a unique sample of listed firms in China, we find that analyst coverage associates negatively with goodwill impairment, consistent with pressuring from securities analysts. Additionally, the pressure is driven by optimistic forecasts and is more likely to encourage impairment manipulation than real earnings management.

Changes to an MC element such as a performance measurement system, however, may in turn create incoherence with other, non-changed elements, generating a need for more changes, and thus trigger a cascade effect. To date, however, we know little about how this sequential process unfolds and what managers can do to deal with incoherence. This paper contributes by enhancing the understanding of sequential changes, drawing on the organizational ecology literature, and we empirically inform our research with a five-year longitudinal case study. Our data illustrates in detail how initial MC changes, intended to cope with an environmental shift, trigger a cascade effect. This sequential process results in an extensive change period, during which various incoherent MC elements coexist. Our study acknowledges that incoherence among MC elements can decrease control effectiveness by creating intra-organizational frictions, yet we highlight the role of managers in mitigating such negative effects. Specifically, we show how managers can alleviate the unfavorable effects of incoherence by changing their use of performance measures in order to better facilitate organizational dialogue, learning and problem solving. © 2020 European Accounting Association.","Change; Management Control; Organizational Ecology; Performance Measurement",,"Toldbod, T.; Aalborg University Business SchoolDenmark; email: tt@business.aau.dk",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

Specifically, focused on firms with above-industry-median TA, the panel regression results show a negative relation between TA and FSR, and the difference-in-differences analysis, based on the ‘Check-the-Box’ regulation in 1997 that exogenously increases tax planning opportunities, suggests the negative impact of TA on FSR is likely causal.

We detail how the opportunity space within which managers maneuver NPD can be underpinned by a hierarchically arranged management control infrastructure governed by management control anchor practices that enable ‘anchored prioritizations’ through which some concerns become ‘more important’ than others. As the anchor practice in our case was an integrative liaison device, we also contribute to research that emphasizes the use of social controls in NPD settings. As management control anchor practice, integrative liaison devices can go beyond the ‘pure’ sharing and integration of knowledge and play a crucial role in framing accountability-induced conflicts and negotiations. We also contribute to the notion of management control anchor practices by considering the dynamics between a constitutive rule and the strategies used to enact it. Management control anchor practices play a crucial role in the light of ‘conservative dynamism’ where strategies through which a constitutive rule is enacted are constantly adjusted. A key role of a management control anchor practice hereby is to avoid the emergence of a state of excessive proliferation where strategies are formed merely based on opportunism or short-term contingencies. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

To test our hypotheses, we apply textual analysis to our data on firms listed in the STOXX Europe 600 for the period 2008–2016. Our investigation of topic-specific CSR disclosure indicates that when firms shifted from voluntary to mandatory reporting, following the announcement of Directive 2014/95/EU, the association between their share price and CSR disclosure became significantly negative. For the period before the announcement, this relationship is either positive or statistically insignificant. We also show that the institutional environment can impact this relationship in four distinct ways: the level of CSR awareness, the level of employee protection, the degree of enforcement and the strength of the legal environment. We find that the first two have a negative impact on the incremental value relevance of specific CSR disclosure, whereas the last two have a positive impact.

This is despite the fundamental changes that have occurred in the Italian social, economic and political environment. This study reveals that even though Italy’s societal institutions have substantially changed, the board of statutory auditors has continued to exist, with no material change in its nature, across different historical blocs, such as monarchy, fascism, post-war socio-democratic republic, neoliberal republic, and major changes in Italian politics and economy. This long-lived accounting institution has also faced a series of potentially significant sources of change, which appeared dramatic at first sight, but had no significant far-reaching historical impact, as hegemony was unaffected. In Italian society, the board of statutory auditors has provided a reassurance role, in principle this is to monitor company directors, a role which is perceived to benefit all society. However, in practice, this institution has provided a legitimating, rather than a substantive monitoring mechanism. It helped to exercise the ruling class’ hegemonic control, whose power was diffused across society through civil institutions during various historical blocs. © 2020, © 2020 European Accounting Association.","Accounting history; Board of statutory auditors; Hegemony; Italy",,"Melis, A.; University of Cagliari, Viale S.

Standard analyses focus solely on the choice between debt and external equity. This results in the traditional tax gain from leverage, which equals the corporate tax benefit from debt minus the partially offsetting personal tax disadvantage. Expanding the debt analysis to include internal equity introduces a third tax component to the gain from leverage: a supplemental personal tax disadvantage. This supplemental disadvantage reflects the personal tax cost of distributing internally-generated equity to investors and using replacement debt. It reduces the overall or comprehensive tax gain from leverage and frequently converts it into a tax loss. Therefore, using debt often is costlier than generally assumed.

In contrast, European regulators ruled in favor of a dual mandatory rotation rule in which both audit firm and audit partner rotations are required. Employing a unique setting where a dual regime of audit and firm rotations are required, we assess the net benefit (cost), of audit firm rotation incrementally to partner rotation. Specifically, we analyze several earnings-based measures of audit quality along with the market perception of audit quality. Controlling for partner rotation, we do not find that firm rotations have a positive incremental effect. In contrast, we find audit partner rotation under the dual regime appears to improve both the earnings-based measures of audit quality, and market perceptions of earnings. Our evidence suggests that any benefit arising from dual rotation is likely to be driven by the change in partner. However, whether the audit firm rotation should still be required is unclear, given that the observed benefits arising from the audit partner rotation could potentially be preconditioned on audit firm rotation. © 2020, © 2020 European Accounting Association.","Audit quality; Audit-firm rotations; Audit-partner rotations; Investor perceptions",,"Pettinicchio, A.; Accounting and Control Area, Via Sarfatti 10, Italy; email: angela.pettinicchio@unibocconi.it",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

When a manager receives unfavorable compensation due to missed performance targets, the table format is easier to understand than the formula format, whereas the latter appears more scientific than the former. These two effects work in opposite directions and therefore, result in an insignificant difference in approval ratings when the table, versus the formula, format is used. However, when the manager receives favorable compensation for beating performance targets, investors do not pay much attention to the disclosure’s understandability but still favor the formula format, as it has a scientific appearance.

These are important issues linked to the rationale for the introduction of the EAR. As prior studies have demonstrated that audit firm size affects investor perceptions across a range of measures, we predict that the link between KAMs (absent versus present) and investor perceptions around value and credibility is affected by audit firm size. We find that the inclusion of KAMs improves perceived value and credibility only when a Non-Big 4 firm conducts the audit. When a Big 4 firm conducts the audit, perceived value and credibility are high whether KAMs are included or not.

We measure relative emphasis, i.e. prominence, based on the first appearance or frequency of GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) dollar amounts in the transcripts of conference calls. To complement our analysis of relative emphasis on non-GAAP earnings, we measure general non-GAAP content using frequency counts of keywords. We find that firms place greater relative emphasis on non-GAAP earnings and include more general non-GAAP content when the non-GAAP results exceed the GAAP results, when the non-GAAP results achieve a benchmark that the GAAP results missed, and when the firm’s GAAP earnings are less value-relevant. We find somewhat weak evidence that impression-management motivation is the dominant explanation for greater relative emphasis on non-GAAP earnings but not for general non-GAAP content.

We find that IR readability is associated with a higher market valuation, conciseness with higher stock liquidity and tone bias with less dispersed analysts’ estimates. Results suggest that market participants appreciate IRs that are readable, short and focused, as well as hint at tone management strategies targeting analysts. We also show that assurance on IR moderates the negative effects of poor textual attributes: if firms publish IRs that are difficult to read but assure them, this compensates for the negative influence of reading difficulty on a market value; if long IRs are assured, this dampens the negative effect of verbosity on liquidity; if firms assure IRs, analysts’ forecast dispersion is lower, therefore suggesting that assurance acts as a credibility-enhancing mechanism for external users.

This focus on heterogeneous arrangements, however, tends to neglect the role of practices and how these practices render MACs fluid. Hence, the study investigates how practices, together with arrangements, which Schatzki (2002. The site of the social: A philosophical account of the constitution of social life and change. University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press) refers to as ‘site’ (i.e. a mesh-work of practice-arrangement bundles), are implicated in MACs’ fluidity. To do so, an ethnography of the MAC ‘Enterprise Risk Management’ (ERM) at the largest division of a multi-national manufacturer was conducted. By analyzing attended risk meetings, the paper shows the ways in which the ERM site prefigures multitudinous paths for carrying on and carrying out risk management activities, which in turn, render the ERM site into a fluid space of intelligibility. These findings indicate that MACs’ fluidity is associated with multidimensional prefigurements that the site produces. With these insights, the paper contributes to understanding how the situated functionality of management accounting comes about, and reveals nuances and multiplicities amid the enabling and constraining space for actions that practiced MACs as mesh-work engender. © 2019, © 2019 European Accounting Association.","Enterprise risk management; Ethnography; Fluidity; Management accounting concepts; Site ontology",,"Tekathen, M.; Department of Accountancy, 1450 Guy Street, MB 14.225, Canada; email: Matthaeus.Tekathen@concordia.ca",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

When the correlation between firms' demands is positive and sufficiently high, disclosure of information on demand uncertainty can enhance social welfare, given that the quality of firms' private information is constant. However, in the setting where firms' private information is endogenously determined, mandatory disclosure is not always desirable. This is because, when disclosure is mandated, firms acquire less precise information compared with the case where the acquired information is not disclosed; hence, their internal information environments are deteriorated.

Taken together, these findings support the idea advocated by New Public Management proponents that results control can enhance employee motivation and performance in the public sector. However, the findings also highlight an essential nuance; in addition to results control, personnel and cultural controls are also important, as they enhance intrinsic motivation and performance. This implies that a sole focus on results control is too narrow and can lead to suboptimal levels of employee motivation and performance in the public sector. © 2018, © 2018 European Accounting Association.","Management Control; Motivation; Object-of-Control; Performance",,"van der Kolk, B.; IE Business School, Calle Pedro de Valdivia 21, Spain; email: berend.vanderkolk@ie.edu",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

In doing so, we focus on how accountants are perceived by others as well as how they perceive themselves. Through analysis of 1,794 usable questionnaire responses by university students, newly appointed accountants, and practicing accountants, we find an image close to the beancounter stereotype, and that of a modern professional, with the highest score for success but also for honesty. We also uncover a third image including nuances that are neither favorable nor unfavorable (the plain vanilla accountant), which suggests that the extremes found in cultural representations do not always reflect the real world. In addition, we find that the greater the distance from the profession, the less attractive the image of accountants is and that different sources of influence affect perceptions of accountants. In particular, the public perception of an accountant is less favorable when constructed from media sources. Finally, we add to the existing literature by showing that the self-image of accountants may change over time as experienced practitioners, compared to new hires, exhibit a sort of disillusionment about their professionalism. © 2018, © 2018 European Accounting Association.","Accountants’ self-image; Accounting profession; Beancounter stereotype; Images of accountants",,"Caglio, A.; Department of Accounting, Via Rontgen 1, Italy; email: ariela.caglio@sdabocconi.it",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

However, as very few authors have empirically assessed these presumptions, we aim to address this gap in the literature. Based on Lucien Karpik’s notions of singularities, judgment devices, forms of involvement, and emulation and rivalry, we assess whether the processes surrounding the production and use of journal rankings might lead to desingularization and dequalification. Our findings support previous research by highlighting that processes where passivity and heteronomy (i.e. lack of autonomy) prevail are conducive to desingularization, rivalry and dequalification. Our findings, however, introduce some nuances into the debate by underscoring instances where emulation logic is employed instead of mere rivalry logic, and where substantial judgment devices and active involvement are mobilized in the production and use of rankings, thereby somewhat alleviating the spread of desingularization and dequalification. Ultimately, our study raises questions that point to a need for serious collective reflection within the academic community on the processes by which published research is evaluated. © 2018, © 2018 European Accounting Association.","Dequalification; Desingularization; Journal rankings; Karpik; Singularities",,"Picard, C.-F.; Faculté des sciences de l’administration, 2325, rue de la Terrasse, Canada; email: claire-france.picard@fsa.ulaval.ca",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

This led the offender to violate professional norms and self-rationalise illegal activity as both temporary and beneficial to his client.

Our review provides several insights. First, fair value measurement is pervasive for investment property, while nearly non-existent for PP&E and intangible assets. Second, external fair value appraisers help enhance the decision usefulness of fair values. Third, the determinants of fair-value-related reporting choices vary by context and are not yet well-understood. Fourth, fair value measurement is largely useful when it comes to the valuation role of financial reporting, but this usefulness varies across recognized and disclosed fair values. Fifth, the contracting implications of fair value measurement for long-lived operating assets are severely under-researched. Overall, whereas extant research provides relevant insights, it is derived from diverse settings employing different measures and research designs, and does not yet provide an accumulation of evidence sufficient for final clarity about the determinants and consequences of fair value measurement for long-lived operating assets.

We use management earnings forecasts to capture corporate voluntary disclosure. Consistent with the opportunism view, but inconsistent with the efficiency argument, our results (including robustness checks) show that offshore firms are less likely to issue earnings forecasts, disclose forecasts less frequently, exhibit a stronger tendency to withhold bad news forecasts, and release less precise forecasts than non-offshore firms. Moreover, of the three distinct dimensions of OFCs’ institutional environment, namely, low taxation, lax regulation, and secrecy policy, each plays a role in negatively shaping firms’ disclosure strategy. Thus, OFCs’ institutional features exacerbate the opacity that plagues firms seeking to avoid taxes via their OFC subsidiaries. Our results are consistent with the notion that, beyond the scope of taxes, multinational firms’ use of OFCs has a corrosive effect on market information dynamics. Hence, OFCs have a much wider impact on the U.S. economy as well as other major economies than just tax avoidance or evasion. © 2018, © 2018 European Accounting Association.","Management earnings forecasts; Offshore financial centers; Regulation arbitrage; Secrecy policies; Tax avoidance; Voluntary disclosure",,"He, L.; John Molson School of Business, 1455 de Maisonneuve Blvd. West, Canada; email: luo.he@concordia.ca",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

Moreover, to better grasp the underlying mechanisms of VBM, we consider potential contingency factors that may affect the relationship between VBM and M&As. Specifically, we examine the risk of managerial self-interest in M&A decisions that may be influenced by a firm's internal, industry- and country-specific contexts.

Survey-based studies have highlighted journals suspected of such coercion but there has been very little empirical analysis of actual citation practice and the respective impact on journal quality rankings. This paper collects information on actual self-citation trends over the period 2000–2012 for all business and management journals indexed in Journal Citation Reports and finds evidence of sudden and sharp increases in self-citation relative to outside citation. This paper also finds that two leading hybrid journal ranking systems, the UK’s 2010 Association of Business Schools (ABS) and the 2013 Australian Business Deans Council (ABDC) rankings, do not discriminate between legitimate and coercive self-citation. Collectively, these findings have implications regarding the institutional reliance placed on citation counts as quantitative measures of accountability. However, the deterrent potential of our analysis, especially given the ease with which coercive self-citation behavior can be empirically detected from publicly available data, could provide an important limit on the spread of performativity. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

We conduct tests based on both stock price and trading volume to provide evidence on the reasons for this apparent market anomaly. We document evidence of earnings management through accruals prior to external financing and lower operating performance afterward that is associated with the amount of capital raised. The earnings management that precedes external financing and the amount of capital raised are associated with both the post-financing decline in stock price and trading volume around earnings announcements that follow for a period of three years. This evidence is consistent with the proposition that firms raise external capital prior to predictable declines in their operating performance and they release upward biased earnings before these events to manage investor expectations. The failure of many investors to incorporate this information into their trading decisions in a timely manner consistent with limited attention and over-confidence appears to drive stock mispricing.

Specifically, we examine the impact of IAS 19R, which increases expected pension-induced equity volatility by eliminating the so-called ‘corridor method’, a smoothing device for actuarial gains and losses. Supported by interview evidence, we show that IAS 19R leads firms to reconsider their pension investment decisions. Using matched samples of treatment and control firms, results from multivariate difference-in-differences tests indicate that firms affected by the adoption of IAS 19R significantly shift their pension assets from equities into bonds, relative to control firms. This effect is attenuated for firms with larger and better-funded pension plans. Supplementary analyses suggest that this shift in pension investment is mainly due to IAS 19R’s changes in the accounting for actuarial gains and losses (the ‘OCI method’). These results are robust to several sensitivity tests, although endogeneity concerns cannot be fully ruled out.

A standard is stable if it is preferred by a large enough super-majority of firms over any other standards. Absent any restriction on possible standards, only unanimity would make a standard stable. By contrast, when requiring standards that classify news from best to worst, there is at most a single stable standard, and it must be full disclosure. For a large class of distributions over valuations, the required super-majority is about two-thirds, close to the majority required in many standard-setting boards. Value distributions with heavy tails, such as news that contains extreme risks, require higher super-majorities to be stable.

In this paper we analyze the optimal allocation of scarce working time to two tasks in a contracting problem. Since each hour devoted to one specific task is not available for the other task, and vice versa, the agent accounts for opportunity cost when allocating his time to the tasks. We analyze this trade-off assuming that the agent's contribution is not contractible, such that a contract must be written based on an alternative measure. Time scarcity restricts total output. At the same time, however, it changes the agent's focus of attention towards the task with the higher performance sensitivity. Thus, by increasing the incentive coefficient the principal induces the agent to shift time from the less sensitive to the more sensitive task. The main contribution of our paper is that we show that time scarcity can improve the congruence of the agent's behavior with the principal's objectives. Under certain conditions an improved alignment of effort under time scarcity offsets the reduction of output and increases the agency's surplus. © 2017, © 2017 European Accounting Association.",,,"Robert Schöndube, J.; Leibniz Universität Hannover, Königsworther Platz 1, Germany; email: schoendube@controlling.uni-hannover.de",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

We find that tax collections significantly increased after the introduction of the whistleblowing mechanism in Israel in February 2013, although this mechanism directly yielded little or no tax collections. In support of the hypothesis that deterrence led to the increase in tax collections, we find that collections increased in industries with high tax-evasion risk, but not in industries with low tax-evasion risk. Furthermore, the increase in tax collections occurred in corporations, where the timing and magnitude of tax payments are more discretionary, but not from employees, for whom employers directly deduct taxes.

We use an institutional logics perspective to challenge existing assumptions about a universally valid meaning of compliance, fraud, and faithful representation. Presenting the case of the Swedish bank HQ, we show how the interpretation of the accounting standard for option measurement varies across different enforcement bodies because the meaning of compliance is socially negotiated across the institutional logics of markets, financial regulation, and law. The independent decision-making of the different enforcement bodies leads to a systematic variation in the interpretation of principles-based accounting standards without ultimate coordination. To define consistent boundaries of compliance across institutional logics, and thus, to distinguish between fraud and allowable managerial discretion becomes problematic. Faithful representation, in turn, cannot be understood as financial statements reflecting a correct value or as financial statements being prepared in accordance with acceptable practice, as suggested in the earlier literature. Instead, faithful representation itself becomes a contextually bound concept, which can only be defined within an institutional logic. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Journal of Accounting Research, 44, 207–242] show that the observed smoothness of earnings (i.e. negative contemporaneous correlation between accruals and cash flows) is the joint product of the role of accruals in smoothing out transitory fluctuations in operating cash flows (noise reduction role) and the role of accruals in providing timely recognition of economic gains and losses (contracting role). These two roles of accruals have opposite effects on earnings smoothness properties. Using a regression framework that allows us to simultaneously consider both roles, we show that failing to control for changes in timely gain and loss recognition as firms shift to IFRS can lead to erroneous inferences regarding the effects of IFRS adoption on earnings smoothness, and consequently on researcher’ conclusions about how IFRS adoption has affected accounting quality. Our results are consistent with mandatory (2005) IFRS adoption resulting in a change in the contracting role rather than the noise reduction role (or smoothness role) of accruals. A decrease in timely loss recognition, an increase in timely gain recognition, and a net decrease in asymmetric timely loss recognition are what drives the change in observed smoothness properties of earnings around mandatory IFRS adoption. © 2018, © 2018 European Accounting Association.","Earnings quality; Earnings smoothing; Timely gain recognition; Timely loss recognition",,"Capkun, V.; Department of Accounting and Management Control, 1, rue de la Libération, France; email: capkun@hec.fr",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

To examine this argument, the paper draws on two recent high-profile fraud cases to critically discuss the extent to which these crimes should be meaningfully and innovatively analyzed as moral actions and the moral context in which they occur. The findings indicate that the feature most relevant to a criminogenic is its moral context in relation to the opportunities and frictions that it generates. As such, environmental factors along with psychosocial processes of moral education become particularly important in the explanation of why certain moral contexts emerge in particular kinds of settings at a particular point in time.

Consistent with predictions, we find that (a) small firms with higher insider ownership and fewer foreign investor holdings are more likely to switch, (b) increasing reporting costs as well as changes in firm-specific circumstances affect switching propensity, (c) switching firms substantially reduce their disclosures after they switch, and (d) switching firms neither experience a decrease in liquidity nor negative announcement returns. Overall, our findings are important for standard setters and securities regulators in shaping (future) reporting requirements for listed firms. © 2017, © 2017 European Accounting Association.",,,"Fiechter, P.; Faculty of Economics and Business, Switzerland; email: peter.fiechter@unine.ch",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

Drawing on the literature on business process management, participative decision-making and self-determination theory, we propose that participation in costing system design fosters managers’ perceived contributions to process improvement through their autonomous motivation for cost management and their perceived usefulness of cost information. Questionnaire data obtained from 170 Belgian managers were used to test the proposed model. The results suggest that participation in costing system design increases managers’ autonomous motivation for cost management and enhances their perceived usefulness of cost information. Managers’ perceived usefulness of cost information is, in turn, positively associated with their perceived contributions to process improvement. The effect of managers’ autonomous motivation for cost management on their perceived contributions to process improvement is, however, not significant. Taken together, our findings imply that contributions to process improvement mainly emerge through informational mechanisms rather than motivational mechanisms triggered by the participation process. © 2017, © 2017 European Accounting Association.",,,"Hoozée, S.; Department of Accounting, Sint-Pietersplein 7, Belgium; email: sophie.hoozee@ugent.be",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

States are more likely to interfere in the decision-making processes of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and demand firm activities that are desirable from a socio-political perspective. For example, to win political support, politicians may instruct SOEs to avoid layoffs to minimize unemployment rates. The varied objectives of SOEs also make it more difficult to control managers' behavior, leaving more room for managerial discretion and the pursuit of self-interests through empire-building behavior. Both state intervention and managerial self-interest restrain managers from laying off employees or reducing employee wages when sales decrease, which may lead to greater labor cost stickiness. Data from 1993 to 2012 reveal that SOEs exhibit greater labor cost stickiness than private firms, and their labor cost stickiness also varies predictably with socio-political variables such as election years and left-wing governments. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

Starting from this premise, we study how the diversity of audit teams in terms of the different mix of work assigned to staff, seniors, managers, and partners influences audit quality and how this effect varies depending upon years of tenure.

Three hypotheses of earnings management–the opportunism hypothesis, the rational expectations hypothesis, and the signaling hypothesis–predict that constrained firms engage in greater upward earnings management than unconstrained firms when selling equity. Using a sample of seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) announced between 1983 and 2014, I find support for this prediction. The relation between financial constraints and earnings management is robust to including controls such as offer size, growth opportunities, analyst following, and chief executive officer equity holdings, as well as to using the instrumental variable approach. Investors’ reaction around and following the SEO announcement supports the rational expectations hypothesis. I find that aggressive earnings management by constrained issuers is associated with lower SEO announcement returns but is not followed by negative abnormal returns in the long run. The evidence suggests that constrained issuers’ aggressive use of income-increasing accruals is an outcome of managerial myopia caused by capital market pressure, not managerial opportunism intended to mislead investors. © 2017 European Accounting Association.",,,"Kurt, A.C.; Sawyer Business School, United States; email: akurt@suffolk.edu",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

The results from a sample of professional investors underline the important role of assurance in the context of voluntary disclosure and illustrate the relevant interaction with the reporting format. Assurance of sustainability information positively affected professional investors’ evaluation of a firm’s sustainability performance, resulted in a higher weighting of this information, and led to higher investment-related judgments.

Analyzing interactions between superiors and subordinates, we examine how and why these two groups of actors mobilize different accounting numbers to make claims about performance and try to persuade the other party. Our interest is with the choice of accounting numbers and how they come to be seen as persuasive. The main theoretical argument developed in this paper is that whether a specific accounting number or indicator comes to be seen as persuasive or not in a particular situation is both a matter of how legitimate the underlying indicator is to the actors involved as well as whether they regard the signal it provides, i.e. the actual outcome on this particular indicator, as salient when compared to the actual outcomes on alternative indicators. Taken together, our findings suggest that persuasiveness is not an ‘objective’ quality of accounting numbers, but a situated achievement that results from interactive alignments between different actors with potentially competing interests. © 2016 European Accounting Association.",,,"Goretzki, L.; Department of Organisation & Learning, Austria; email: lukas.goretzki@uibk.ac.at",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

I thus also explore the mediating role of OBA in linking key antecedents and performance within a unified theoretical framework. I empirically test my model using survey data from a sample of European companies, which are then analyzed through structural equation modeling. My findings indicate that the extent of OBA use is explained by a firm’s willingness to work together with its counterparts in the long run, that is, a relational factor, and the presence of sophisticated cost accounting systems, that is, a technical prerequisite. My evidence also suggests a positive association between OBA and firm performance. Additionally, I find that OBA is a partial mediator that explains how a firm’s long-term commitment to its external partners and the sophistication of its cost accounting system may become associated with performance. © 2017 European Accounting Association.",,,"Caglio, A.; Accounting Department, BIDSA Fellow, Via Roentgen 1, Italy; email: ariela.caglio@sdabocconi.it",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

We argue that a research agenda may be formed around the notion that the IASB differs from national standard setters because its constituent base includes jurisdictions as well as the more traditional preparer, user and auditor constituency groups. We show that taking a jurisdictional angle draws attention to the variety among the IASB’s jurisdictional constituents, identifying numerous research possibilities related to their decisions to adopt, or not to adopt, IFRSs, and to the mechanisms they have developed to form their own IFRS policies and to interact with the IASB. We illustrate how the IASB’s structure, governance, processes and standards are influenced by the challenge of reconciling the needs and values of jurisdictional constituents with the objective of setting global accounting standards. We call for research on the ramifications of the diversity of jurisdictional constituents, as well as changing perceptions of standard setting within jurisdictions, for all aspects of the functioning of the IASB.

A higher level of aggregation, as reflected in a firm’s reported organizational structure (the definition and characteristics of its segments), causes a multiple-segment firm to exhibit less cross-segment variation in profitability than a matched control portfolio of single-segment firms. We find that firms that engage in more aggregation report accounting numbers that provide less timely information about economic losses. We also observe that firms that provide more disaggregated segment data subsequent to adopting SFAS 131 experienced an increase in timely loss recognition. This result implies that higher quality segment reporting leads to an increase in timely loss recognition, which, per extant research, is associated with better governance.

Such incentive systems enable agents to improve their performance ranking not only by increasing their own performance, but also by undermining their competitors’ performance. While previous accounting studies have stressed the positive effect of ranking systems on managerial effort, the present paper investigates when such ranking systems may induce sabotage, and how this unintended effect can be mitigated. Our study is based on a laboratory experiment designed to investigate (a) whether competitive performance feedback increases an agent’s inclination to disrupt the efforts of competitors, in a case where ranking has no effect on compensation and (b) whether the presence of a self-set absolute performance target moderates these effects. Our results show that ranking increases both performance and sabotage. Adding an absolute performance standard appeared to reduce sabotage. However, when there is an absolute target, performance is higher in the absence of ranking. Overall, our results thus suggest that performance benefits from the use of either a relative or an absolute performance target, but not from their simultaneous use. © 2016 European Accounting Association.",,,"Schreck, P.; School of Law and Economics, Große Steinstr. 73, Germany; email: philipp.schreck@wiwi.uni-halle.de",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

Investor ignorance of the drift following guidance news coupled with a fixation on post-earnings announcement drift potentially explains this surprising difference in the timing of the post-announcement returns. Overall, this study indicates that bundled quarterly earnings guidance contains more information than quarterly earnings and that investors incorrectly overweight the earnings news and underweight the guidance news during the post-announcement period until the next earnings announcement. © 2016 European Accounting Association.",,,"Milian, J.A.; School of Accounting, 11200 SW 8th St, United States; email: jamilia@fiu.edu",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

Shareholders who grant loans have a dual stakeholder role, being both equity holders and creditors. Those loans could be lost, because bankruptcy law requires their subordination in the event of bankruptcy. We therefore expect shareholder loans to mitigate agency problems of debt. This reduces the need for debt covenants and earnings smoothing. Moreover, the interest payments from shareholder loans tend to lower payout volatility which also reduces the need for dividend and earnings smoothing. We expect and find that private firms with shareholder loans exhibit significantly lower levels of earnings smoothing than other private firms. We find that with a 10 percentage-point increase in the shareholder loans to total assets ratio, earnings smoothing decreases by about 10% of the mean value. We also find that this substitution effect usually occurs in case of managerial ownership and tends to be slightly weaker in the event of dispersed ownership. The results are robust for different econometric specifications, including different measures of key variables and propensity score matching. The paper suggests that financial reporting by private firms responds to the dual stakeholder role of shareholder loans. © 2016 European Accounting Association.",,,"Bigus, J.; Department of Finance, Garystraße 21, Germany; email: jochen.bigus@fu-berlin.de",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

Difference-in-differences tests based on director deaths and regulatory changes in the early 2000s suggest that the adverse effect of long director tenure on innovation performance is causal. I also find that the effect is mitigated when long-tenured directors have more years of overlap in service with CEOs, and when long-tenured directors are executives at other firms.

Taking framing theory and the sociological literature on risk as conceptual starting points, we find that consultants engage in specific framing strategies to persuade clients by rhetorically weaving a series of financial risk objects, financial de-risking strategies, and calls for action. We also find that current and prospective clients sometimes contest consultants’ prescriptions, despite the pervasiveness of risk management as the ultima ratio of organizational governance. This contestation occurs, ironically, because adopting de-risking solutions in one area is perceived by some clients as triggering new risks in areas unforeseen by consultants. This research increases our knowledge of how new risk objects and de-risking solutions come into existence and why some risk management practices fail to be diffused within organizations despite the staggering success of the risk management rationality.

When stock-based compensation motivates managers to share their private information with shareholders, it will expedite the pricing of future earnings in current stock prices. In contrast, when equity-compensated managers attempt to temporarily manipulate the stock price to maximize their own benefit rather than that of shareholders, the market may not fully anticipate future performance. We find that a CEO’s stock-based compensation strengthens the association between current returns and future earnings, indicating that more information about future earnings is reflected in current stock prices. In addition, we find that the positive effect is weaker for firms that have a high level of signed discretionary accruals or a low management forecast frequency.

Our simulation results show DTD, which allows firms to accelerate and also to postpone depreciation, to be much more effective than bonus depreciation in reducing the expected value of tax payments, especially in crisis periods. Using a sample of 325 clients of a single office of a Dutch accounting firm, we show that DTD has led to higher investments in assets qualifying for discretionary depreciation for firms that faced the highest marginal tax rate. For other firms, the additional investments crowd out investments in assets that do not qualify for DTD. Our analysis on the actual depreciation choices reveals that firms postpone depreciation when facing losses or loss carry forwards, or to smooth taxable income under the progressive tax system. Our results suggest that a fiscal policy that permits firms to postpone depreciation, as well as to accelerate, may stimulate investment. © 2017 The Author(s).

Most European countries provide simplified, cash-based rules of tax accounting for small firms that considerably deviate from their general accrual tax accounting rules. The small business sector is thereby sought to be protected from disproportionally high compliance burdens. Simplified tax accounting, however, is only available for non-corporate businesses. If simplified tax accounting is indeed associated with a net benefit, its (un-)availability can change the relative gain to incorporation. We test this conjecture using data on corporate shares of business in 27 European countries over the period 2004–2010.

Three different types of tax privacy are tested, ranging from complete privacy to full disclosure. We expect two different effects: first, a contagion effect, arising when an individual observes non-compliance of other individuals and therefore reduces her own tax compliance; second, a shame effect of increased tax compliance due to the anticipated shame of being declared a tax evader. Both these effects are supported by the experimental results. However, the shame effect reduces tax evasion only in the short run. The influence of shame diminishes over the course of the experiment with subjects observing the non-compliance of other participants. Thus, our results indicate that when the contagion and the shame effect are present the latter is not strong enough to override the former in the long run. Furthermore, disclosing tax information anonymously increases tax evasion compared to providing no information on tax evasion behavior. These observations are of particular importance for tax policy because public disclosure may lead to more evasion instead of less when supporting a crowding-out of the tax morale. © 2016 European Accounting Association.",,,"Blaufus, K.; Leibniz University Hannover, Koenigsworther Platz 1, Germany; email: blaufus@steuern.uni-hannover.de",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

Use of a theoretical model shows that wage taxes can have a substantial impact on the outcome of such a competition if marginal tax rates are different as in an international labor market. Further, the paper shows that increasing the wage tax rate unilaterally can have an ambiguous effect on observed gross compensation levels. However, in a local labor market for CEOs, observed gross fixed salaries should decline in the wage tax rate. Tax effects in a market for CEOs is a particularly interesting topic because recent developments with respect to compensation practices of top-level managers have opened a public debate about the use of instruments for regulating compensation of those managers. Furthermore, many countries around the world use tax incentives in order to facilitate immigration of highly skilled human resources. The investigation follows an analytical economics-based approach by extending an LEN model with elements of competition for scarce human resources and income taxation. It investigates the impact of differential taxation on the competition between two firms for the exclusive service of a unique, highly skilled CEO. © 2016 The Author(s).

If the investment level influences the riskiness of the investment project, the capital charge rate deviates from the firm's cost of capital and depends crucially on the manager's personal income tax rate. Contradicting conventional wisdom, we find that a higher personal income tax rate induces higher investment expenditures and, surprisingly, increases the capital charge rate. The countervailing effect that a higher capital charge rate induces higher and not lower investment expenditures persists for pre-tax and after-tax performance measures as well as when the tax deductibility of managerial compensation is limited. Corporate income tax causes a similar effect only in the case of limited tax deductibility of compensation.

In many countries, firms can request fee-based advance tax rulings (ATRs) to mitigate tax uncertainty. We analyse theoretically the circumstances under which investors request ATRs, how tax authorities should price them and how they can affect investment. We assume that tax authorities integrate investors’ reasoning into their decisions. We find that in special cases the optimal fee tax authorities should charge is prohibitively high, thus firms will refrain from requesting ATRs. However, we find that revenue-maximising tax authorities offer ATRs if the ruling enables them either to significantly reduce their tax audit costs or to increase the probability of detecting ambiguous tax issues. Under certain circumstances, ATRs may effectively foster investment and potentially benefit both the tax authorities and taxpayers. Our results provide new explanations for why taxpayers that face high levels of tax uncertainty often do not request ATRs, even when the fee is rather low. Our results also hold when the tax authority maximises social wealth instead of its revenues.

We empirically demonstrate that fair value adjustments on investment property are persistent, while those on financial securities are transitory. We further show that only fair value adjustments from investment properties are distributed. We argue that managers perceive the persistence of the two fair value components correctly, and by doing so, they distribute income consistent with the Lintner framework rather than on regulatory recommendations.

In this study, we empirically examine whether a corporate tax rate reduction under an imputation tax system benefits shareholders. Using Taiwan as a setting, our analyses indicate that decreasing the corporate tax rate is associated with an increase in dividend payout ratio and foreign investment. Moreover, the increase in dividend payout ratio is even greater for firms that have a higher increase in foreign ownership. Additionally, the market reacts positively to an announcement of a tax rate reduction; specifically, positive stock price reactions are stronger for firms that experienced a greater increase in foreign ownership in response to the tax rate reduction, for firms with greater liquidity constraints and more growth opportunities before the tax rate reduction, and for firms with a bigger decrease in effective tax rates after the tax rate reduction. Overall, we provide evidence that a tax rate reduction is associated with economic impacts and that foreign shareholders appear to be the main beneficiaries of a tax rate reduction under an imputation tax system. © 2016 European Accounting Association.",,,"Chen, M.-C.; Department of Accounting, No. 64, Sec. 2, ZhiNan Road, Taiwan; email: mingchin@nccu.edu.tw",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

I show that when an outgoing CEO (O) in period 1 is succeeded by an incoming CEO (N) in period 2, strategic interaction between O and N leads to interlinked earnings reports. Specifically, when the level of earnings reported by O is lower, N's reporting strategy is more likely to feature a downward reporting bias. Furthermore, by a comparison of the two-CEO setting with a setting with no CEO turnover, I show that with CEO turnover, (i) the period 2 earnings report is more sensitive to the private information of the CEO in control and less sensitive to the period 1 earnings report; (ii) the period 1 earnings report is more sensitive to the private information of the CEO in control; and (iii) the equilibrium stock price has the same sensitivities toward the associated risks, but is less sensitive to the periods 1 and 2 earnings reports.

Further, police work is surrounded by multiple pressures to make it both economical and effective. Consequently, there are multiple institutional logics in decision-making which may affect the selection and the use of police key performance indicators (KPIs). The KPI selection and use processes reflect the institutional logics, though KPI use may also sometimes influence the institutional logics of police work. In this study, we analyze the KPIs and institutional logics in police work in Finland and Spain. A comparative case research approach is used in order to highlight the differences in institutional logic emphases and in circumstances. Data from semi-structured interviews, internet reports, project work, and discussions are used. Both similarities and differences in the KPIs and in the institutional logic emphasis are found between the Finnish and Spanish police. Understanding the partly general and partly locally constructed nature of institutional logics may facilitate the development of police work performance measurement. We also suggest ways of coping with multiple institutional logics. For example, risk analyses and selecting KPIs against the current institutional logic may facilitate organizational developments. © 2015 European Accounting Association.",,,"Rautiainen, A.; Jyväskylä University School of Business and Economics, P.O.

Specifically, control environment, information and communication, and monitoring are significantly and negatively associated with future stock price crash risk. Moreover, the negative association between internal control and crash risk is significantly more pronounced in firms with weak internal and external governance (i.e. audited by non-Big 4 auditors, located in provinces with low market development, and less conservative in accounting) and with poor ability to mitigate impacts of extreme negative events (i.e. non-state-owned enterprises).

Since 2010, all Chinese audit firms were required to transform from a structure of limited liability company (LLC) to limited liability partnership (LLP), which removes the cap on the liability exposure of negligent auditors. By adopting this natural experiment, we document the following findings: first, after audit firms reorganize as LLPs, auditors are more likely to (1) issue modified audit opinions and going-concern opinions, (2) constrain clients’ earnings management, and (3) charge a premium in audit fees, which suggest that exerting unlimited legal liability on negligent auditors improves both audit quality and audit fees. Second, the effect of the LLP adoption is more pronounced when auditors are from local audit firms, and clients are controlled by local governments. Further analyses suggest that the stock prices of clients positively react to the reform event, which indicates that LLP adoption improves the overall value of audits. In summary, our empirical findings are consistent with the argument that legal liability is able to effectively shape auditor behavior in emerging markets where the other institutional mechanisms are relatively weaker and government intervention is heavy. © 2015 European Accounting Association.",,,"Tian, G.; Department of Finance, Australia; email: gary.tian@deakin.edu.au",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

Using data from Thomson Reuters News Analytics, we find evidence supporting the view that media content, positive and negative, has incremental information. Regarding the moderating role of accounting quality, pre-existing accounting information of higher quality could enhance investors' reactions to media content by providing a more precise baseline, or it could reduce investors' reactions to the news if investors anchor on higher quality financial statements.

We find that greater board independence is insignificantly associated with a change in audit fees when client firms operate in a weak information environment. When the information environment is strong, greater board independence is associated with an increase in audit fees.

While in other countries such as the UK and the USA, efficiency in buying and managing war material was an important part of military strategy, in Italy, various factors impeded it. This paper focuses on contracting procedures adopted by the Ministry of War and Ministry of Munitions and looks at the cost accounting practices in Ansaldo to see how costs were determined and how prices were set. We found a paradox. On the one hand, despite knowledge of costing, the government did not impose cost controls on the producers of war material, nor on their profit rates. On the other hand, examining Ansaldo's cost sheets we discover they underestimated their production costs leading the firm to losses despite its favorable political position. This paper contributes to the theoretical debate about the relationships between accounting and war in the Italian context where lobbying, collusion, bribery and private interests dominated the administrative behavior of public and private actors instead of efficiency, accountability and honesty. © 2015 European Accounting Association.",,,"Vollmers, G.; Maine Business School, 5723 DP Corbett Hall, United States; email: gloria_vollmers@umit.maine.edu",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

We extend previous research by comparing practices among different ownership types (i.e. public, non-profit, and private) and by providing initial evidence on compensation schemes for the clinical staff. Our empirical investigation is embedded in the ‘stewardship–agency axis’ that allows the development of theoretical arguments about the interdependencies between ownership and performance measurement systems (PMS). We distinguish two primary levels of analysis – the types of measures implemented and their linkage with compensation and decision-making. Our findings suggest that the types of measures are primarily affected by regulatory pressures, while powerful internal actors considerably influence the linkage between these measures and compensation. Consistent with our theorised patterns, cross-case analyses indicate differences between ownership types concerning the performance dimensions that are prioritised and the linkage of performance measures with compensation of the clinical staff. Together, these findings provide evidence on the interdependent effects of the regulatory environment, the type of ownership and internal actors on a hospital's PMS.

Relying on a cultural perspective of analysis highlighting the range of social processes that protect prevailing institutions’ legitimacy from aberrations, we examined the sense-making approaches employed by corporate boardroom actors to maintain their confidence in the credibility of the risk management apparatus despite being exposed to a continuous flow of corporate failures pointing to risk management efficacy limitations. Specifically, we conducted 35 interviews with corporate board stakeholders, mostly board members and corporate consultants. Our analysis indicates that actors involved in risk management processes tend to interpret aberration cases through perspectives that put the blame on some implementation deficiency, thereby ensuring that risk management’s core assumptions are not questioned. These perspectives point to a defensive system of thought grounded in the director and consultancy communities, whose main referents are subject to intense work and re-conceptualization in the aftermath of aberrations, thereby providing community members with the means to make sense of the frictions of organizational life in ways that maintain the legitimacy of the risk management apparatus. © 2015 European Accounting Association.",,,"Gendron, Y.; Faculté des sciences de l’administration, 2325, rue de la Terrasse, Local 6224, Canada; email: yves.gendron@fsa.ulaval.ca",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

This paper challenges this premise and shows that there are situations in which ‘better’, that is, more forward-looking, accounting standards reduce the information content of financial reports. The reason is that a forward-looking accounting standard affects the smoothness of reported earnings, which can conflict with the manager's smoothing incentive and her willingness to incorporate private information in the financial report. Although the manager could eliminate the effect by earnings management, it is too costly to do so. As a consequence, the capital market's ability to infer the financial and nonfinancial information in reported earnings declines. This finding should increase the awareness that an ‘improvement’ in accounting standards, without considering incentives and other information residing in firms, can adversely affect the quality of financial reporting. © 2015 European Accounting Association.",,,"Ewert, R.; School of Business, Universitaetsstrasse 15, Austria; email: ralf.ewert@uni-graz.at",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

Investor disagreement is relevant for its repercussions on stock market efficiency. However, the literature related to the effect of firms’ reporting policies on disagreement is scant. Prior research suggests that conservatism, by requiring higher verifiability of profits, constrains earnings overstatements and encourages more complete revelations of losses, thus improving the information environment. In this paper, we further hypothesize that these effects of conservatism enhance news credibility and decrease information asymmetry, particularly for bad news announcements. This results in a lower disagreement and improved interpretation of earnings news. We consistently find that conservatism measures are negatively associated with proxies of announcement-time investor disagreement and that this effect is stronger when the firm is reporting bad news. Additional analyses indicate that the impact of conservatism is stronger when market surprise to the announcement is greater, while it is weaker in the presence of frequent and precise voluntary disclosure that preempts the earnings announcement.

By exploring the literature dealing with the concept of hope and by drawing on the debate on the relationship between accounting and action, we highlight the features of three hope-related concepts (hopelessness, naïve hope, and reflective hope). We also highlight how these concepts relate to different areas of uncertainty (validity, accuracy, and relevance) in the development of accounting technologies. Evidence collected through particiapant observation of a team involved in the construction of indicators offers empirical material to investigate the interplay between hopelessness, naïve hope, and reflective hope in relation to uncertainties concerning the link between accounting and action. Beyond analyzing how team members move from a naïve to a reflective hope in making the accounting–action link, the paper shows that among practitioners it is accepted that unintended consequences constitute the rule rather than the exception in the accounting–action link. © 2016 European Accounting Association.",,,"Catasús, B.; Stockholm Business School, Sweden; email: bino.catasus@sbs.su.se",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

Discretionary R&D capitalization can be exercised by managers to signal private information on future economic benefits to the market. It can, however, also serve as opportunistic earnings management. We analyze a unique, hand-collected sample of highly R&D intensive German IFRS firms during 1998–2012. We find that market values are not associated with capitalized R&D for the overall sample, indicating that earnings management may be a concern. We identify firm-years for which R&D capitalization is possibly used for pushing their earnings above a specific threshold (e.g. analysts' forecasted earnings, prior year's earnings). Our results show that both the decision to capitalize and how much to capitalize are strongly associated with benchmark beating. Consistently, we find that market values are negatively associated with capitalized R&D for firms who are likely to use capitalization for benchmark beating (about one third of the overall sample). On the other hand, the market values R&D capitalization positively for well-performing firms, for which capitalizing does not matter to beat an earnings benchmark (about half of the overall sample).

The empirical analysis, which relies on case study methodology, highlights the inherent tensions associated with the changing role of IA and shows how different types of IA developed in three case settings, shaped by the agents’ embeddedness in different institutional fields. This article provides a more comprehensive approach to the study of IA adoption and development in public sector organizations than previous literature, and it highlights the relevance of the interplay between actors’ contemporary embeddedness in professional systems and the focal social system as a relevant source of practice variation.

Focusing on project finance transactions, an average return on investment (AROI) is drawn from the pro forma financial statements, obtained as the ratio of aggregate income to aggregate book value. We show that such a metric correctly captures a project's economic profitability, as long as it is compared with a comprehensive weighted average cost of capital (WACC) that includes a correction factor that takes account of the capital foregone by the investors. In contrast to the internal rate of return, AROI is unique, and we provide an explicit functional relation that links it to the NPV.

On the other hand, behavioral literature suggests that agents also adhere to descriptive norms established by peers. Most studies examine these effects in isolation, ignoring the role of mechanisms that firms use to detect misreporting. This research examines if the effects of incentives and descriptive peer norms depend on whether the firm uses an audit system to detect misreporting. In an experiment, we vary the material payoffs for lying (low vs. high compensation rate), the behavior of peers (low vs. high honesty), and the use of audits to detect misreporting (audited vs. not audited). Results indicate that the effect of peer behavior depends on the use of audits. When reporting decisions are audited, descriptive peer norms have a strong effect on the level of truthful reporting. We do not find evidence indicating that the effect of incentives depends on audits. Our findings have important implications for practice.

We provide evidence that greater board independence leads to lower information asymmetry. Next, we provide evidence that more voluntary disclosure and greater analyst coverage are two underlying mechanisms via which greater board independence reduces information asymmetry. Of the two mechanisms, we find that analyst coverage is more significant in influencing how board independence affects information asymmetry.

The model identifies the optimal disclosure strategies that constitute a perfect Bayesian equilibrium by type of competition and uncertainty. In Cournot competition, both firms disclose information under cost uncertainty, while only the SOE or neither firm discloses information under demand uncertainty. Alternatively, in Bertrand competition, only the joint-stock company discloses information under cost uncertainty or demand uncertainty.

In our research setting, auditors are appointed for a three-year period and their term can be renewed twice up to a maximum of nine years. Since the auditor has incentives to be re-appointed at the end of the first and the second three-year periods, we expect audit quality to be lower in the first two three-year periods compared to the third (i.e. the last) term. Assuming that a better audit quality is associated with a higher level of accounting conservatism, and using abnormal working capital accruals as a proxy for the latter, we find that the auditor becomes more conservative in the last three-year period, i.e. the one preceding the mandatory rotation.

Probability weighting encourages an auditor to overrate the audit risk and the likelihood of damages leading to inflated audit fees which could help to explain the BigN audit-fee premium. With loss aversion, an auditor is sensitive to the risk of damage compensation and, thus, tends to exert excessive caution which also generates excessive audit fees. Consequently, investors may choose not to hire an auditor and, as a result, may forego an otherwise profitable investment. These effects are more intense with a strict liability regime than with a negligence rule because with the latter, the auditor is not held liable when due care has been exerted. This removes the risk of incurring losses.

The performance target in this study is determined by a peer group's average productivity. We find that performance is significantly higher for bonus-framed contracts when the performance target is revealed ex post, as opposed to ex ante. In contrast, revealing the peer-based performance target ex ante or ex post has no impact on performance for penalty-framed contracts. We also find that the ex post, bonus-framed contract significantly outperforms the other three contracts.

While the commonly applied effort measure is based on analyst behaviour for one firm, our measure considers analyst behaviour for all covered firms. Our general effort measure captures additional information about analyst effort and thus can identify accurate forecasts. We emphasise the importance of investigating analyst behaviour in a larger context and argue that analysts who generally devote substantial forecast effort are also likely to devote substantial effort to a specific firm, even if this effort might not be captured by a firm-specific measure. Empirical results reveal that analysts who devote higher general forecast effort issue more accurate forecasts. Additional investigations show that analysts' career prospects improve with higher general forecast effort. Our measure improves on existing methods as it has higher explanatory power regarding differences in forecast accuracy than the commonly applied effort measure. Additionally, it can address research questions that cannot be examined with a firm-specific measure.

We use this exogenous shock to the contracting environment to infer market perceptions of the usefulness of the regulation. Using event study methodology, we investigate market reactions for the first-time announcement of regulatory intent and for a pooled sample of seven events leading to the adoption of the law act.

Multivariate analyses reveal that firms which were particularly affected by the regulation because board members received high abnormal remuneration experienced larger stock price discounts on average. Consistent with this, we find a positive relation between pay-performance sensitivity and the equity market reaction. Taken together, these findings indicate that the regulation was not considered beneficial from a shareholder perspective.

Following the requirement that firms classify the debt-like hybrid security MRPS as a liability, the share of MRPS issuances in firms' new financing declined. Characteristics of firms issuing MRPS also changed. While prior to SFAS 150 firms with higher levels of debt and lower coverage ratios chose to issue MRPS and not debt, after its adoption, the decision to issue MRPS is no longer related to firms' pre-existing debt and coverage levels. Furthermore, our results indicate that before SFAS 150 managers were willing to bear the higher issuance fees of MRPS and chose to issue these debt-like hybrid securities over cheaper debt.

Complemented by hand-collected data of national regulatory changes consistent to the EC principles, we employ the regime shift as quasi-experiment.

The setting is the microprocessor industry, one in which technical information is particularly significant and complex to digest. Based on 3837 analyst earnings-forecast revisions, issued by 134 analysts, we examine quantitatively the speed, magnitude, and information content of the reactions of individual analysts and subgroups of analysts to both periodic and timely technical disclosures, and as a complement to periodic financial disclosure. We find that analysts are much slower to react to timely technical disclosures than they are to periodic financial disclosures. We find also that technical and financial disclosures complement each other. Furthermore, we find that there is a ‘hierarchy’ of analysts in this particular industry, as evidenced through the strength of reaction to timely technical disclosures. Finally, we find that lower speed in reacting to timely technical disclosures and a higher intensity in the use of timely technical disclosure (in conjunction with periodic financial disclosure) result in greater accuracy, and that more experienced analysts tend to be less accurate.

The results indicate that, on average, institutional ownership is negatively related to the profitability of insider trading, and this relationship derives from both direct monitoring and trading/pricing.

Using a sample of NASDAQ OMX companies in Finland, we identify the audit partner assigned to each public-client engagement. We expect that partners with greater public-client specialisation provide higher quality auditing, since they have likely developed deep domain-specific knowledge and a keen sense of the litigation and reputational risks posed by public clients. In addition, the willingness to resist client pressure likely increases with the number of public clients in the partner's portfolio because dependence on any one client diminishes, which should help to ensure audit quality. The results show that public-client specialisation is negatively associated with abnormal accruals, and this result is attributable to audit partners with three to six public clients. The results of supplemental tests imply that public-client specialisation is more important when general auditing experience is lower. Further, the results reveal that in our setting of high-tax and high alignment between financial reporting and tax reporting, greater public-client specialisation is particularly associated with smaller income-decreasing abnormal accruals, suggesting that auditors with greater public-client specialisation likely recognise the downside reputational implications and achieve audit quality by discouraging tax avoidance. © 2014 European Accounting Association.",,,"Johnstone, K.; University of Wisconsin School of Business, 975 University Avenue, United States",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

We posit that carbon emissions affect firm valuation only to the extent that a firm's emissions exceed its carbon allowances under a cap-and-trade system and the extent of its inability to pass on carbon-related compliance costs to consumers and end-users. We measure a firm's ability to pass on the future costs by its market power and its carbon performance relative to its industry peers. The results show that firms' carbon allowances are not associated with firm valuation but the allocation shortfalls are negatively associated. We also find that the negative association between firm values and carbon emission shortfalls is mitigated for firms with better carbon performance relative to their industry peers and for firms in less competitive industry sectors. These findings, which suggest that the valuation impact of carbon emissions is unlikely to be homogenous across firms or industrial sectors, have important implications for future research design and for the disclosure and recognition of a firm's greenhouse gas liabilities. © 2015 European Accounting Association.",,,"Clarkson, P.M.; UQ Business School, The University of QueenslandAustralia",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

We reveal how an evolving socio-economic and political context, and the embedding of central actors in multiple fields, facilitated entrepreneurial action by actors who took political opportunity, mobilised important allies, and accommodated the interests of major protagonists. We draw attention to the possibility of an earlier inversion of the cascading institutionalisation process than is envisaged by Dillard et al. (2004).

We investigate an international sample of start-ups, including their detailed MCS adoptions and financing histories. We find that higher MCS intensity, which is measured as the number of systems adopted at year-end immediately prior to the financing round, has a positive impact on company value. We also find that equity financiers value MCS more than do debt financiers. The valuation implication is more pronounced for start-up companies operating in highly competitive environments and with higher growth.

The state's establishment of a class of ‘expert accountants’ in 1865 represented an imperfect closure of the profession. In consequence, a chain of closure attempts ensued. These ventures involved shifting constructions of dominant and subordinate occupational groups and the deployment of diverse strategies to achieve usurpationary and exclusionary forms of closure. The study reveals that the achievement of state regulation of the profession in 1906 reflected the successful pursuit of usurpationary closure by a subordinated group within the accountancy field. However, it also points to the failure of the profession's efforts to make incursions into the jurisdictions of higher status occupations, especially lawyers, who wielded considerable sociopolitical power in newly unified Italy. Consistent with the findings of previous studies, the paper confirms the complexity and uncertain outcomes of closure projects in the accountancy profession. © 2014 European Accounting Association.",,,"Sargiacomo, M.; Department of Management and Business Administration, University G.d'Annunzio of Chieti-Pescara, Viale Pindaro 42, Italy",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

Both ownership and more transparent reporting have the potential to align incentives between managers and investors thereby reducing systematic risk. Employing a large global sample across 35 countries over the 1990–2004 period, we show that country-level disclosure regulation is negatively related to (i) inside ownership, and (ii) firms' implied cost of capital and realised returns. We then introduce ownership into the cost of capital model, and also find a negative relation. These relations extend to the systematic component of the cost of capital, estimated from Fama–French portfolio sorts on ownership and disclosure regulation. Thus, while the direct effect of disclosure on cost of capital is negative, the indirect effect via ownership is positive, consistent with disclosure quality and ownership acting as substitutes. Using path analysis to assess the relative magnitude, our estimates suggest that the direct effect of disclosure quality outweighs the indirect effect by a ratio of about five to one. © 2014 European Accounting Association.",,,"Hail, L.; The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, 3620 Locust Walk, United States",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

We exploit the revealed preferences in the choice to (not) adopt IFRS voluntarily to determine whether the management of individual firms had incentives to adopt IFRS. For comparability with previous studies, we assess accounting quality through multiple constructs such as earnings management, timely loss recognition, and value relevance. While most existing literature documents accounting quality improvements following IFRS adoption, we find that improvements are confined to firms with incentives to adopt, that is, voluntary adopters. We also find that firms that resist IFRS adoption have closer connections with banks and inside shareholders, consistent with lower incentives for more comprehensive accounting standards.

Since CEOs can have different incentives towards conservatism, we focus on ownership of non-CEO founding family members in our investigation. We find that conservatism increases with non-CEO family ownership, supporting our prediction. This relationship becomes insignificant in family firms with founders serving as CEOs, either due to founder CEOs’ incentives to implement more conservative financial reporting or their power to thwart non-CEO family owners’ demand for conservatism.

In an attempt to accelerate and support research in the field, in this article we highlight theoretical and empirical challenges that accounting scholars need to consider when addressing issues related to accounting and reporting in family firms. These challenges include the selection and potential mixing of appropriate theoretical frameworks, and complications in defining operationally what family firms are. We also provide a ‘state of the art’ of studies in financial accounting, management accounting and auditing, identifying which issues in relation to family firms have been addressed in the research, and which theories, research methods and types of data have been used in these studies.

Although studies have suggested that occupational prestige is important, the prestige of management accountants within the employing organisation and its consequences are still not fully understood. Building on social identity theory, we investigate the effect of occupational prestige, as perceived by management accountants, on organisational–professional conflict. We suggest that prestige can mitigate conflict because management accountants with high prestige will identify more strongly with their organisation, as they see it as a source of self-esteem and might believe that they are taken more seriously by managers. At the same time, we hypothesise that prestige exerts an indirect conflict-increasing effect via professional identification. This is based on the idea that prestige may cause proud management accountants to start to identify more strongly with their profession and become hard-liners, unwilling to compromise the values associated with their profession in the interest of the firm. Results from a series of three surveys support the indirect conflict-increasing effect. Moreover, the results suggest a direct conflict-reducing effect of perceived prestige.

In the experiment, a manager makes a decision about the stochastic dividend process generating the firm's fundamental value, and shareholders make estimations about fundamental value and trade shares in a stock market. The manager's action is either known or hidden and, nested in the hidden-action condition, compensation is either simple or complex. We hypothesise that hidden action gives rise to perceived behavioural uncertainty, and that this uncertainty has valuation relevance in that it affects both individual estimations of fundamental firm value and stock prices. Furthermore, we hypothesise that perceived behavioural uncertainty increases with the complexity of compensation, and that compensation complexity also affects trading volume. We find supporting evidence for our conjectures. Both estimations and market prices are biased when the manager's action is hidden, and biases are stronger when compensation is complex. We further find that trading volume decreases when compensation is complex, even though the heterogeneity of investors' individual beliefs increases. © 2013, © 2013 European Accounting Association.",,,"Gillenkirch, R.M.; University of Osnabrück, Rolandstr. 8, Germany",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

The findings illustrate how a number of antecedents to deinstitutionalisation acted in each setting and show that abandonment was only achieved through skilful agency by dominant insiders to construct the need and manage for change. In addition, a finding of the study is that two of the four companies reversed the deinstitutionalisation and reintroduced traditional budgeting. This is explained by highlighting the role of remnants of formerly institutionalised practices and by demonstrating the importance of administrative and cultural controls which can support the abandonment of a central accounting control practice in the first place.

Positive abnormal returns from hedge portfolios on both accrual measures summarise the economic significance of this generalisation. The magnitude of returns obtained from traditional accruals is higher than that obtained from percent accruals, contrary to existing evidence from the U.S. capital market. The magnitude of the accrual effect on stock returns based on both accrual measures is stronger in countries with higher individualism, lower uncertainty avoidance, higher equity-market development, higher equity-market liquidity, lower transaction costs, higher analyst coverage, lower analyst optimism, and lower ownership concentration. In markets where minorities have legal protection against expropriation by corporate insiders and where accrual accounting is permitted, the accrual effect based only on percent accruals is positive. Earnings opacity does not appear to exhibit a significant influence.

Little empirical evidence has been provided to explain the impacts of cost accounting systems that make a larger portion of firms' total environmental costs visible. The aim of this study is to conceptually and empirically examine the relationships among the tracking of environmental costs (TEC) by firms, their environmental motivations, and the impacts in terms of environmental and economic performance. Using survey data from a large sample of manufacturing firms, the results suggest two main conclusions. First, the TEC has an indirect influence on economic performance through environmental performance. Second, this indirect effect is influenced by the environmental motivations of the firm. More specifically, this indirect effect is greater (lesser) for firms whose motivations are predominately business-oriented (sustainability-oriented). © 2013, © 2013 European Accounting Association.",,,"Henri, J.-F.; School of Accounting, Université Laval, Pavillon Palasis-Prince, 2325 rue de la Terrasse, Canada",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

While existing methods use preselected bandwidths for kernel density estimation and histogram construction, the proposed test procedure addresses the key problem of bandwidth selection by using a bootstrap test to endogenise the selection step. The main advantage offered by the bootstrap procedure over prior methods is that it provides a reference distribution that cannot be globally distinguished from the empirical distribution rather than assuming a correct reference distribution. This procedure limits the researcher's degrees of freedom and offers a simple procedure to find and test a local discontinuity. I apply the bootstrap density estimation to earnings, earnings changes, and earnings forecast errors in US firms over the period 1976–2010. Significance levels found in earlier studies are greatly reduced, often to insignificant values. Discontinuities cannot be detected in analysts’ forecast errors, while such findings of discontinuities in earlier research can be explained by a simple rounding mechanism.

The first driver is the presence of a performance-reporting task, by which we mean managers may exert effort to improve the precision of their performance measures. The second is limited managerial attention, where performing one task may have an adverse effect on the cost efficiency of performing another. We show that the subtle interactions of the two drivers may alter the characteristics of incentive provision. First, the interaction may lead to a positive relation between the strength of the incentive and the variance of the performance measures. Second, the interaction may cause an informative performance signal to not be used in equilibrium incentive contracts. In particular, it is possible that the principal will not use a signal whose precision can be improved by the manager in order to discourage the manager from diverting attention to the performance-reporting task. Finally, we apply the model to a project-selection setting and show that, in order to induce the agent to choose higher risk, higher return projects, the principal may need to raise the bonus rate when the choice of project is unobservable. © 2014, © 2014 European Accounting Association.",,,"Liang, P.J.; Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Ave, United States",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

The study refines, and in certain respects develops the theory of MA absence by combining it with the theory base of MA change and stability. The theoretical analysis suggests that a wide variety of factors may explain the absence or the mode of presence of MA in NPD. These identified explanatory factors are analysed further within the developed theoretical framework. The strongest empirical evidence for MA absence arises from technical, economic and functional factors. Furthermore, lack of reasons-for-adoption of MA systems and other forms of control associated with engineering-oriented culture lead to MA absence in NPD. The empirical findings also reveal a number of variant modes of MA presence with only the 'accounting thinking' and concepts adopted in NPD.

In order to fill this gap, the paper provides a case study analysis of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adoption and its impact on and implications for an accountant's role, positions, practices and work in a continental European context. This study describes how IFRS expect information preparers to take more responsibility for reporting than domestic accounting standards. Thus, the present study contributes to the literature by arguing that it depends on the set of accounting standards how they impact on accountants' work. The study shows why and how especially IFRS' requirement of 'business involvement' in accounting revolutionises accountants' work and how it has implications on their roles, practices and positions in the case firm. Finally, the paper explains how learning and knowledge creation required by IFRS adoption was made possible through communities of practice and hence how it was possible to clarify the responsibilities of divisional and group accountants in the case firm.

Amir and Lev [(1996) Value relevance of nonfinancial information: the wireless communications industry, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 22(1-3), pp. 3-30] argue that accounting information is not useful for intangible-intensive firms. In contrast, Collins et al. [(1997) Changes in the value relevance of earnings and book values over the past forty years, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 24(1), pp. 39-67] find that the value relevance (measured by R-squared) of accounting information has increased over time and that value relevance for intangible-intensive industries is as high as that for tangible-intensive industries. In this article, we attempt to resolve the above discrepancy by examining the impact of scale on R-squared (Brown, S., Lo, K. and Lys, T. (1999) Use of R2 in accounting research: measuring changes in value relevance over the last four decades, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 28(2), pp. 83-115). We find that, after controlling for scale, R-squared is lower for intangible-intensive industries than for non-intangible-intensive industries and has declined over time for intangible-intensive industries but remained stable for non-intangible-intensive industries. Interestingly, the declining trend ended with the demise of the 'New Economy' period (NEP) (Core, J. E., Guay, W. R. and Van Buskirk, A. (2003) Market valuations in the New Economy: an investigation of what has changed, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 34(2-3), pp. 43-67), and value relevance for both industry groups appears to be restored in the post-NEP to the pre-NEP level.

The goal of this paper is to improve our understanding of the welfare consequences of disclosure in duopoly markets and to identify market settings where proprietary costs are a viable argument for firms to remain silent. We, therefore, solve the optimal disclosure strategies and distinguish two different potentially costly effects of disclosing private information: the strategic information effect and the market information effect. We identify the market settings for which a regulator prefers to impose disclosure regulation so as to maximise consumer surplus or total surplus. Regulation may be necessary because (i) the increase in welfare outweighs proprietary costs to the firms, or (ii) firms are trapped in a prisoners' dilemma. The first primarily applies to Bertrand competition with demand uncertainty and, to a lesser extent, to Cournot competition. The second applies primarily to Cournot competition and Bertrand competition with cost uncertainty. © 2013 © 2013 European Accounting Association.",,,"Wielhouwer, J.

However, if the stock is traded on a quote-driven system, market makers can collude to maintain wide bid-ask spreads that discourage firms from disclosing. As a result, TTGS traded on a quote-driven system can face a liquidity trap that can prevent them from harvesting the benefits of increased disclosure activities. In this paper, we argue that the well-documented negative relation between disclosure and the bid-ask spread is likely to be moderated by the type of protocol chosen by exchanges to handle the trading of TTGS. To test our theory we use a unique setting created by the introduction of a hybrid order-driven protocol for TTGS in the UK. Following an increase in the disclosure activity by a TTGS, we find that the magnitudes of the predicted reductions in the bid-ask spreads are dependent on whether the TTGS switch their trading protocols. © 2013 © 2013 European Accounting Association.",,,"Raonic, I.; Cass Business School, London, United Kingdom; email: i.raonic@city.ac.uk",,"Routledge",09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

Estimating the MV of private companies for tax purposes is a challenging task for tax authorities as MVs are not available. In this study, I empirically analyse to what extent an accounting-based tax valuation method for private companies, a simplified residual income model, succeeds in matching the MV. I refer to the mandatory Standardised Combination Model that is a special case of methods commonly used in several countries. In the absence of market prices for private companies, I use a sample of small German public companies as a proxy. I validate this approach using a sensitivity analysis that involves matching the sample of public companies with that of private companies. The results imply that the mandatory Standardised Combination Model leads to a severe unequal treatment not only between public and private companies but also among private companies across and within industries. Furthermore, I simulate the effects of variation in the key parameters and highlight their impact on the approximation quality of the Standardised Combination Method.

This is arguably due to an audit having elements of a public good, which may result in not enough audits being purchased without regulatory intervention. The mandatory nature of public company audit has created problems for researchers wishing to investigate the demand for voluntary audit. Recent events in the UK, however, have provided such an environment. In the UK, private companies must publicly file financial statements and, until recently, they had also to be audited. However, this requirement has now been relaxed for many private companies. We are therefore able to examine the determinants of voluntary audit in a large sample of companies for which we have financial statement data. We analyse a sample of 6274 recently exempt companies, following them for three years post-exemption. We use agency theory and prior evidence to generate our hypotheses and examine them using a more comprehensive set of explanatory variables than has previously been available in the literature. Our results indicate that companies are more likely to purchase voluntary audits if they have greater agency costs, are riskier, wish to raise capital, purchase non-audit services from their auditor, and exhibited greater demand for audit assurance in the mandatory audit regime. We also document a trend away from audit over time. Overall, our results strongly support the idea that companies choose to be audited when it is in their interests to do so. © 2013 © 2013 The Author(s).

The experiment manipulates whether or not evaluators are subject to process accountability as well as the role to which evaluators are assigned (i.e. supervisor or subordinate). We predict and find that, in general, the provision of an implementation timeline results in evaluators placing more weight on strategically linked, leading non-financial measures within a subordinate's time span of control compared to strategically linked, lagged financial measures beyond the subordinate's controllable time horizon. However, we also find that evaluators in the role of a supervisor differentiate less between strategically linked non-financial measures that fall within the subordinate's control and strategically linked financial measures beyond the subordinate's control when held accountable compared to supervisors not held accountable. On the other hand, participants in the role of a subordinate were able to differentiate appropriately between these measures when held accountable. Our results extend prior research by considering how linking a timeline to strategy implementation may assist evaluators when assessing performance in the presence of both leading and lagging strategic measures. Further, reference to an implementation timeline may influence role and accountability effects.

Using a battery of tests, we show that market value deflation is essential in market-based tests of dividend displacement and signalling because it controls for 'stale' information in addition to scale (size) differences across firms. For US firms, we show that after controlling for 'stale' information, the empirical association between dividends and market values switches from positive to negative. This switch is not explained by scale differences across firms. Further, we show that after controlling for staleness, the valuation of dividends remains positive for European firms. This result is explained by the relatively stronger association of dividends with future earnings in these settings (i.e. signalling).

In response auditors considered whether the pricing of audits should be revised to take account of the increased risk of regulatory intervention and litigation. Obviously such re-pricing would need to be targeted at those firms for which the risks were greatest. One early warning signal of such events occurring is the issuance by the Security Exchange Commission (SEC) of a Comment Letter (CL). We investigate whether there is any evidence that if a client receives a CL this is used to re-price audit services. Specifically, we investigate whether issuance resulted in upward pressure on audit fees, and whether this effect was simply transient around the issuance period or alternatively persisted some years into the future. This research finds that after a client receives a CL, auditors adjust audit fees upwards in the period in which the CL is received. In addition it is shown that for subsequent periods in which the auditor does not spend time assisting the client respond to a specific CL, an initial rise in audit fee persists. This is consistent with the hypothesis that auditors reassess the reputation and litigation risk of the client on the basis of the SEC issuance of a Comment Letter. © 2013 © 2013 European Accounting Association.",,,"Pettinicchio, A.

This overview paper uses recent studies in the field to illustrate how hospital choices are driven by the institutional environment in which hospitals operate. Incorporating the richness of this institutional environment into research may help researchers to make better predictions about: 1) why certain accounting systems or types of governance models are implemented or maintained; and 2) why certain intended outcomes are not always realised. The paper also sets out a research agenda that further capitalises on the impact of multiple institutional stakeholders within hospital decision-making structures.

The model allows for information asymmetry in a finitely repeated sender-receiver game and solves for sequential equilibrium to show that if there are some trustworthy managers who always disclose their private information and choose to return a fair proportion of the firm's income as dividend to the investor, then a rational manager will mimic such behaviour in an attempt to earn a reputation for being trustworthy. The rational manager will mimic with probability 1 in the early periods of the game. The investor, too, will invest with probability 1 in these periods. However, in the later periods, the rational manager will mimic with a certain probability strictly less than 1. The probability will be such that it will make the investor indifferent between investing and not investing, and he, in turn, will invest with a probability (strictly less than 1) that will make the rational manager indifferent between mimicking and not mimicking; that is, the game will begin with pure-strategy play but will switch to mixed-strategy play. There is one exception, though: when the investor's ex ante beliefs about the manager's trustworthiness are exceptionally high, the game will continue in a pure strategy, and the switch to mixed-strategy play will never occur.

Headquarters-subsidiary interdependencies refer to the extent to which headquarters and subsidiaries depend on each other to accomplish their tasks. When headquarters-subsidiary interdependencies are present, it becomes more difficult to reward the performance of subsidiary managers because these interdependencies induce noise on subsidiary-level accounting performance measures, while at the same time high levels of goal alignment between headquarters and subsidiary managers are required. Based on survey data from 82 foreign subsidiaries operating in Belgium with headquarters in 14 different countries, our partial least squares path modelling results show that as headquarters-subsidiary interdependencies increase, headquarters use more participative performance evaluation and consider more the effects of uncontrollable factors on subsidiaries' performance when rewarding subsidiary managers. More importantly, while prior research suggests that interdependencies induce noise on unit-level accounting performance measures, our results indicate that participative performance evaluation may mitigate the noise so that headquarters still rely on subsidiary formula-based compensation using accounting measures to reward subsidiary managers. © 2013 Copyright European Accounting Association.",,,"Du, Y.; IESEG School of Management (LEM-CNRS), 3 rue de la Digue, 59000 Lille, France; email: y.du@ieseg.fr",,,09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

Contracting includes multiple rounds of renegotiation based on contractible accounting information and non-contractible but more timely non-accounting information. We show that accounting regulation aimed at increasing earnings quality from a valuation perspective (earnings persistence) may have a significant impact on how firms rationally respond in terms of allowing accrual discretion in order to alleviate the impact on the stewardship role of earnings. Increasing the precision of more timely non-accounting information (analyst earnings forecasts) increases the ex ante value of the firm and reduces costly earnings management. There is an optimal level of reversible non-discretionary accrual noise introduced through revenue recognition policies. Tight rules-based accounting regulation, as opposed to leaving firms more choice over non-discretionary accrual policies, may lead firms to rationally respond by inducing costly earnings management.

We investigate whether capital gains taxation influences immediate and delayed investments asymmetrically, given the optimal abandonment decision. If capital gains taxation induces a lock-in effect, this effect is anticipated in the investment timing decision. In contrast to prior research, our numerical simulations show that this lock-in effect of capital gains taxation can induce normal as well as paradoxical effects on investment timing under simultaneous entry and exit flexibility. A paradoxical timing effect, i.e., investment accelerated by capital gains taxation, especially emerges for high liquidation proceeds or, more conservative tax accounting, low interest rates, and low volatilities. In these cases, capital gains taxation reduces the value of the option to invest and hereby increases the propensity to invest immediately. As a second paradoxical tax effect, capital gains taxation may favor delayed real investment over financial investment. Facing these results, tax legislators should not use capital gains taxation as a short-term tax policy instrument to influence investors' timing decisions. © 2013 Copyright European Accounting Association.",,,"Niemann, R.; University of Graz, Universitaetsstr. 15, A-8010, Graz, Austria; email: niemann@uni-graz.at",,,09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

In particular, an analysis of the published literature reveals a relevant gap between the strategic and financial perspectives in addressing this issue, and Agency Theory was proposed as a linking construct to bridge this gap. A survey was conducted among 82 companies, and the data were treated using the structural equation modelling technique. The results of this survey indicate that firms with intensive external funding use sophisticated capital budgeting methods more frequently when evaluating the profitability of their long-term investment proposals. As these methods require detailed information, these firms use additional appraisal mechanisms to conduct their investment analysis more frequently. Additional mechanisms are also used if the long-term investment is funded by external sources and perceived as a riskier investment. These deeply analysed long-term investment proposals often appear and are decided as a part of the strategic planning process instead of being strongly associated with the budgeting process. Finally, these long-term investments, which are funded externally, analysed using sophisticated methods and mechanisms and decided as a part of the strategic planning cycle, are more tightly controlled than other investments. These findings help to reduce the heuristics within the related literature. © 2013 Copyright European Accounting Association.",,,"Frezatti, F.; Department of Accounting and Actuarial Sciences, Av.

We develop a structural equation model that allows us to separate the effects of changes in disclosure quality from other effects of the introduction of international accounting standards on forecast errors. Our sample comprises 1,908 firm-years covering the period from 1997 to 2005. We measure disclosure quality with data from a yearly annual-report competition. We find that the introduction of international accounting standards has been associated with a significant improvement in forecast accuracy. Increases in the quality of companies' disclosures appear to have contributed to this improvement. However, the disclosure effect, while significant, explains only a small portion of the overall improvement in forecast accuracy. Further analyses show that differences in disclosure quality are more relevant for German GAAP companies than for IFRS/US GAAP companies. Moreover, only the quality of notes to companies' financial statements appears to matter to analysts; the quality of management reports appears to make no difference.

For a large sample of conference calls, hosted by German firms between 2004 and 2007, our results show that conference calls improve analysts' ability to forecast future earnings accurately. This suggests that additional information is released during conference calls. The reduction in forecast error is economically significant and larger in magnitude when compared to results for the US (Bowen et al., 2002). These findings are consistent with the notion that committing to additional disclosures is likely to yield greater effects in a less stringent disclosure system (Verrecchia, 2001). Since the majority of our sample firms conduct conference calls as closed calls, the evidence of this paper suggests that conference calls may contribute to an information gap between call participants and non-invited parties.

This allows us to disentangle the tax-minimisation incentive from other (un-observable) incentives, including debt contracting, dividends and employee relations that contribute to the observed anomalous positive relationship between write-offs and profitability.

Based on the stated objectives of the EU's so-called 'IAS Regulation', we distinguish between intended and unintended consequences of mandatory IFRS adoption. Empirical research on the intended consequences generally fails to document an increase in the comparability or transparency of financial statements. In contrast, there is rich and almost unanimous evidence of positive effects on capital markets and at the macroeconomic level. We argue that certain research design issues are likely to contribute to this apparent mismatch in findings. The literature investigating unintended consequences of mandatory IFRS adoption is still in its infancy. However, extant empirical evidence and insights from non-IFRS settings suggest that mandatory IFRS adoption has the potential to materially affect contractual outcomes. We conclude that both the intended and the unintended consequences deserve further scrutiny to assess the costs and benefits of mandatory IFRS adoption, and we provide specific guidance for future research. © 2013 Copyright European Accounting Association.",,,"Brüggemann, U.; Institute of Accounting and Auditing, Unter den Linden 6, 10099 Berlin, Germany; email: u.bruggemann@hu-berlin.de",,,09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

In fact, the subordinates' ability to retaliate against their superior for prior punishments in the repeated setting by reporting more slack in later rounds has negative effects on the use of audits and decreases audit efficiency.

This paper focuses on the indirect costs of these two regimes. The paper develops a model in which payouts are restricted by one of the two regimes and the equity holders have the choice between extending and liquidating the existing investments. I find that both regimes will create first-best incentives if their respective design parameters are properly balanced. Under a legal capital regime, however, first-best will be a random event, because accounting standards typically do not allow for the necessary interdepencies between the accounting for liabilities and investments. The advantage of a solvency test with respect to the implementation of first-best incentives diminishes if equity holders can misreport future prospects. Under the legal capital regime, misreporting incentives can be excluded by sufficiently conservative depreciation.

As these transactions were under-regulated before International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 2, we expect that the strong debate that occurred during the 1990s resulted in conflicting opinions when this standard was under discussion. To analyse lobbying behaviour and assess its influence on the IASB's decision-making, we conducted a content analysis of 539 letters addressing the documents issued by the G4+1 and the IASB preceding IFRS 2. Consistent with the rational-choice model, our analysis of lobbying activity shows that preparers constituted the most active group, particularly when the IASB started the project, whereas participation of standard-setters increased at the end, which is more consistent with institutional theory. A common strategy was to provide arguments merely on points of disagreement. Preparers and consultants constituted the only groups using economic-consequences arguments to disagree, but later enlisted conceptual arguments as well.

In an experiment, we test whether the type of client affects auditors' independence. Unique features of the German institutional setting enable us to realistically vary the type of auditors' client as our treatment variable: we portray the client either as the management preferring aggressive accounting or the oversight board preferring conservative accounting. We measure auditors' perceived client retention incentives and accountability pressure in a post-experiment questionnaire to capture potential threats to independence. We find that the type of auditors' client affects auditors' behaviour contingent on the degree of the perceived threats to independence.

We choose to adopt a multi-issue/multi-period approach to investigate constituents' formal participation. An analysis of comment letters sent directly to the IASB over the period 2002-2006, reveals that preparers sent most letters followed by the accounting profession and standard setters. With regard to timing, we find that preparers concentrate their participation efforts at a later stage in the process compared to the other constituents, who react earlier. Formal indirect participation in the IASB's due process by submitting comment letters to EFRAG is infrequently used by European constituents. In those cases where constituents exert influence to both IASB and EFRAG, they often use exactly the same comment letter. Concentrating on the drivers to participate, the data reveal that preparers, accountants and standard setters react significantly more when proposals have a major impact on the accounting numbers of a company. Users, stock exchanges and their supervisory authorities write significantly more comment letters when disclosure issues are at stake. Finally, participating preparers in the IASB's due process are larger and more profitable than non-participating preparers. © 2012 Copyright European Accounting Association.",,,"Jorissen, A.; Department of Accounting and Finance, Prinsstraat 13, 2000 Antwerpen, Belgium; email: ann.jorissen@ua.ac.be",,,09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

We use separate samples and empirical designs for public and privately held companies in Sweden, where a sufficient number of companies have a joint audit on a voluntary basis. Our empirical findings suggest that companies opting to employ joint audits have a higher degree of earnings conservatism, lower abnormal accruals, better credit ratings and lower perceived risk of becoming insolvent within the next year than other firms. These findings are robust to the use of a propensity score matching technique to control for the differences in client characteristics between firms that employ joint audits and those that use single Big 4 auditors (i.e. auditor self-selection). We also find evidence that the choice of a joint audit is associated with substantial increases in the fees paid by the client firm, suggesting a higher perceived level of quality.

Yet there is no unequivocal evidence as to whether this bias is the product of conscious efforts to manage the impressions of the audience or the result of unintentional cognitive biases. The present study contributes to this discussion by comparing the narratives of the letters addressed to shareholders of Europe's most highly-capitalized companies in crisis and non-crisis settings. We find that a crisis situation leads to more extensive use of self-serving bias as adverse external economic conditions are used by managers to present themselves in the best possible light. Given that the letters to shareholders are widely used for capital allocation decisions and considering the evidence that intentional self-serving behavior can be successful, our results imply that investors need to be alert to misleading explanations of performance, particularly during external crises. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has formulated a practice statement proposing non-mandatory guidance on the management commentary that accompanies financial statements.

However, prior literature reports contradictory empirical evidence regarding such real activity manipulation. Drawing on the institutional perspective, we hypothesise that firms' market power and interorganisational dependence affect their cost-management strategies and choice of overhead allocation in response to dual payment systems. Analysing the data of California hospitals from 1980 to 1991, we find that when facing a dual payment system, dominant (strong market position) hospitals adopt a cost-revenue-enhancing strategy, increasing direct costs for cost-based services without containing costs in fixed-rate services. In contrast, nondominant hospitals choose a cost-reduction strategy and improve operation efficiency on fixed-rate services. We also find that nondominant hospitals shift more overhead costs away from fixed-rate services to cost-based services by reclassifying the allocation bases across services; combining this cost shifting with the cost-reduction strategy, nondominant hospitals demonstrate the compliance with the regulation expectation of cost containment. © 2012 Copyright European Accounting Association.",,,"Hsu, S.

An in-depth empirical analysis of a software firm and three of its projects shows that management controls may act as important mechanisms of knowledge circulation and that some principles reinforce this function.

Although changing over time and varying from country to country, NPM involves the use of private sector methods in the public sector. Traditionally, performance measurement in universities has had a developmental role - helping individuals to improve their (future) performance. However, the new systems seem more judgemental - i.e. seeking to quantitatively evaluate (past) performance. We study performance measurement in two Accounting and Finance groups - one in the Netherlands and one in the UK. In both we see an increasing use of judgemental forms of performance evaluation and, in particular, the use of more quantitative performance measures. The use of these more judgemental quantitative systems is seen to have various effects. Although these systems emphasise objective quantitative measures, they relocate subjectivities (usually at a greater distance from the subject), rather than remove them. This creates uncertainty and anxiety about how the systems are used. There is a danger that the new systems could inhibit creativity in teaching and limit contributions to the world outside the university. Furthermore, they could damage creativity and innovation in accounting research - as researchers play safe in getting the publications they need. As we are both researchers and practitioners in this area, we should be challenging these trends and pointing to the dangers for research (and teaching) in our field. © 2012 Copyright European Accounting Association.",,,"ter Bogt, H.

Key features of our model are: the development of a relation between future cash flows from fee income and the bank value that depends on lending, borrowing and off-balance sheet business; and the inclusion of proprietary investment and trading as value-driving activities. Empirical tests on a sample of Euro-zone banks from 1998 to 2006 provide the following evidence. Unrealised expected cash flows from fee income are the most important source of unrecorded goodwill. This is consistent with the increasing importance of revenue from the sale of financial services to banks' income. The contribution of fee income to goodwill is higher for banks with large deposits and new loans. Equity securities are a source of unrecorded goodwill, but the introduction of fair value accounting, with the adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), reduces their valuation role. Yet equity securities remain positively associated with unrecorded goodwill after IFRS adoption, suggesting that the fair value standards do not fully capture market expectations about future cash flows of investment assets. © 2012 Copyright European Accounting Association.",,,"Isidro, H.; ISCTE Business School, Avenida das Forças Armadas, 1649-026 Lisboa, Portugal; email: Helena.isidro@iscte.pt",,,09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

In operation since 2005, the German enforcement mechanism consists of a private body, the DPR, which investigates compliance of published financial reports of firms listed on a regulated market segment and, upon error findings, involves the German securities regulator BaFin, which on a second level enforces disclosure of these findings to establish adverse disclosure ('name and shame'). For a sample of error findings published in the period 2005-2009, we investigate short- and long-term market reactions to error announcements. Results for abnormal returns, abnormal trading volumes and abnormal bid-ask spreads indicate that these announcements represent new, negative information and suggest that, despite an enforcement environment that is categorised as weak in the extant literature, the activities of the DPR/BaFin seem to penalise infringing firms and thus provide potential deterrence. Multivariate analyses yield weak evidence that the magnitude of the market value discount is positively associated with the severity of the errors, with the threat of subsequent litigation and with cases in which firms disagreed with the error findings of the DPR. © 2012 Copyright European Accounting Association.",,,"Hitz, J.-M.; Georg-August-Universität Göttingen, Platz der Göttinger Sieben 3, 37073 Göttingen, Germany; email: hitz@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de",,,09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

More recently, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has decided to issue a new standard that will eliminate choice between EM and PC and require only EM; but as of October 2010 a new standard was still to be issued. The past Canadian and proposed IASB changes are similar in that choice between the same two reporting methods is removed but differ in the required alternative, PC for Canada and EM for the IASB. In this paper we use a sample of Canadian companies over the period 1985-2003 to study financial reporting for joint ventures. To our knowledge, our Canadian sample is the only one reflecting a reduction of choice in financial reporting methods for joint ventures. Therefore, our results have particular relevance for evaluating the IASB's proposed change. Specifically, we investigate whether firms that use EM between 1985 and 1994 experience a decline in value relevance of key balance sheet amounts such as total assets and liabilities when forced to use PC from 1995 onwards. Since 1995 firms are also required to provide footnote disclosures on their share of joint venture assets and liabilities in addition to revenues, expenses and cash flows. Using these disclosures, we investigate whether disaggregate joint venture assets and liabilities are incrementally and overall value relevant. We find that firms that are forced to switch from EM to PC experience a decline in value relevance of reported assets and liabilities. The firms that use PC for the entire sample period experience no such decline. We also find that joint venture assets and liabilities are incrementally and overall value relevant when disclosures are mandatory from 1995 onwards. Our results show that the removal of choice of financial reporting method does have value-relevance implications, something that is of importance to users. We also find that the requirement of additional disclosure of joint venture assets and liabilities is value relevant, which may offset, to some extent, the costs of the reduction in choice. Our inferences may have implications for a number of jurisdictions across Europe and beyond that are affected by a similar reduction of accounting choice proposed by the IASB. © 2012 Copyright European Accounting Association.",,,"Soonawalla, K.; Department of Accounting, , London WC2A 2AE, United Kingdom; email: k.soonawalla@lse.ac.uk",,,09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

For Australian and UK companies, we find - as expected - that there were few policy changes. However, despite the constraints on policy change within IFRS, we find that French and Spanish companies not only made more changes than the other companies but that they also made more changes after transition than at transition. Further investigation reveals that these findings are largely driven by a small number of topics. One possible explanation for the pattern of these changes is a 'learning' process, which is supported by finding that nearly all the post-transition changes made by the French and Spanish companies were away from previous national requirements. However, we consider other possible explanations. We also present the profiles of IFRS practices for 2008/9. Despite the changes in policy from 2005/6, we find clear evidence that national patterns of IFRS practice continue through the period, so that international comparability remains in doubt. © 2012 Copyright European Accounting Association.",,,"Nobes, C.; Royal Holloway, , Egham TW20 0EX, United Kingdom; email: chris.nobes@rhul.ac.uk",,,09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

The dual role raises the issue of whether auditors are sufficiently independent of management to act fairly with respect to both shareholders and supervisors. In contrast, recent literature and policy-making on regulation advocates the need to close the distance between regulators and those regulated, and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has advocated a closer relationship between banking supervisors and banks' external auditors. The paper investigates the dual role by providing empirical evidence from interviews undertaken with Swiss audit partners, and analysis of documentary material from the Swiss banking regulator and IMF. The paper concludes inter alia that the Swiss dualistic system 'works' because it is supported by a layered regulatory approach at audit firm, national and international levels to ensure and safeguard auditor independence and competence. Whether such a system would work elsewhere depends on national factors such as conceptions of the nature of corporate governance and of the state, and prevailing views on private actors undertaking public roles. © 2012 Copyright European Accounting Association.",,,"Dewing, I.

Although this interpretation is supported by substantial evidence that the Basu coefficient is associated with likely demands for conservatism, concerns have arisen that it may reflect factors not directly related to conservatism, and that this may adversely affect its validity as an indicator of that phenomenon. We argue that evidence on the validity of the Basu coefficient as an indicator of conditional conservatism can be obtained by disaggregating earnings into components, classifying those components by whether or not they are likely to be affected by conditional conservatism, and examining whether the Basu coefficient arises primarily from components likely to be affected by conditional conservatism. We implement this procedure for UK firms reporting under FRS 3: Reporting Financial Performance from 1992 to 2004. Although a substantial proportion of the Basu coefficient emanates from cash flow from operating and investing activities (CFOI), which cannot directly reflect accounting conservatism, its incidence across other components of earnings is predominantly within those components likely to be affected by conditional conservatism. Also, although the bias documented by Patatoukas and Thomas in 2009 is present in all of our aggregate earnings measures, it is heavily concentrated in the CFOI component of earnings and largely absent from components classified as likely to be affected by conditional conservatism. With the important caveat that researchers should test the robustness of their results to the exclusion of the element of the Basu coefficient due to cash flows, our findings are consistent with the conditional conservatism interpretation of the coefficient. © 2012 Copyright European Accounting Association.",,,"O'Hanlon, J.; Department of Accounting and Finance, , Lancaster LA1 4YX, United Kingdom; email: j.ohanlon@lancaster.ac.uk",,,09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

One major limitation of those studies is that none has tried to find out whether voluntary disclosures were occasional or continuous over time. Yet this point is particularly important, as the voluntary disclosure mechanism can only be fully effective if the manager consistently reports the same items. This paper examines the factors associated with the decision to stop disclosing an item of information previously published voluntarily (henceforth 'information withholding' or IW). To measure information withholding, we code 178 annual reports of French firms for three consecutive years. Although disclosure scores are relatively stable over time, we find that this does not mean there is no change in voluntary disclosure across the years. We document that IW is a widespread practice: on average, one voluntary item out of seven disclosed in a given year is withheld the following year. We show that information withholding is mainly related to the firm's competition environment, ownership diffusion, board independence and the existence of a dual leadership structure (separate CEO and chairman). © 2012 Copyright European Accounting Association.",,,"Jeanjean, T.; ESSEC Business School, Avenue Bernard Hirsch 95000, Cergy, France; email: jeanjean@essec.edu",,,09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

We argue that these non-core earnings should have different properties and different valuation implications than operating or core earnings. Furthermore, the different types of firm ownership may have differential impacts on the information content of earnings components. Based on data from 1996 to 2008, we find that core earnings are more persistent than non-core earnings. Because of this, core earnings have a greater association with contemporaneous stock returns. However, the stock market does not fully incorporate all the information in earnings; we find that core earnings are undervalued and non-core earnings are overvalued. This effect is much reduced for privately controlled listed firms.

This process has been shaped by the tensions and power relationship between moderate and radical reformers and the interaction of their reform strategies. This paper demonstrates that, unlike many reforms in former socialist countries, the Vietnamese accounting reform resulted from both external pressures and internal needs. Because Vietnam switched from state capitalism to a type of mixed capitalism, the country was in a position to adapt the former 'socialist' accounting system relatively 'quietly', moving towards a private capitalist accounting model but preserving many fundamental peculiarities of the old system. The maintenance of the old accounting structure can be explained by the continuity of the political, economic and social environment. However, the transformation has also generated some difficulties due to adapting a private capitalist accounting system to work in a state-dominated market economy. © 2011 European Accounting Association.",,,"Phuong, N.

Rich, detailed data-sets from all three countries are analysed together and in comparison. As theory is not well developed at the level of detail of the data collected, the purpose of this study was primarily exploratory, to provide empirics that can lead to the development of theory. The findings show that Chinese firms are much more likely to provide incentive compensation than are Dutch firms, and they are even somewhat more likely to provide them than are US firms. But Chinese bonus plans are more likely to be subjective, rather than formula-based. In the situations where incentive payments are based on pre-set formulas, the Chinese firms' systems are more like those used in the Netherlands than in the USA, with bonuses based on non-financial performance measures and with more complex performance-reward functions. Like managers in the US firms, but unlike managers in the Dutch firms, Chinese managers who receive some form of incentive compensation are more satisfied with their pay.

As an undercurrent to the opportunities for research, however, I emphasize the importance of considering organizational design, comprised of both structure and culture, in understanding the inevitably intertwined effects of distorted incentives and information failings, among other problems that seem to all have contributed in some way to the crisis. In respect of the opportunities for management accounting research, I mainly discuss a continuing need to study incentives; a motivation to study risk management; an opportunity to reinvigorate budgeting research; and an invitation to study financial companies and the challenges of disclosures. © 2011 European Accounting Association.",,,"van der Stede, W.

We extend prior research on this topic, informed by critical and institutional theories, with insights from the garbage can literature and focus on a key decision-making process involved in making extant management control practices more customer-focused. Our analysis nuances the predictions of critical scholars, suggesting that customer orientation initiatives will commodify public services and narrow the interests served by public sector organizations. In doing so, we draw attention to how conflicting institutional arrangements fostered a garbage can situation hampering radical change in management control practices. Our garbage can analysis provides a bridge between critical and institutional perspectives by re-instating a focus on decision-making. We show how the intricacies of decision-making may moderate the power embedded in novel management control practices and foster inertia and unintended outcomes. Our analysis also raises important policy implications pertaining to the possibilities of combining customer orientation efforts with rationing of public services. © 2011 European Accounting Association.",,,"Modell, S.; Manchester Business School, Crawford House, Booth Street West, Manchester M15 6PB, United Kingdom; email: sven.modell@mbs.ac.uk",,,09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

Although the Eighth Directive envisaged one group of statutory auditors in each Member State, there were two groups of auditors in Denmark, and the implementation of the Directive triggered a long conflict between the two groups about the education of the second-tier auditors. The analysis is based on the work of Abbott (1988) on professional jurisdictional disputes and shows how the local implementation of the Eighth Directive on auditor qualifications disturbed the balance of the 'system of professions' in Denmark and gave rise to an intra-professional conflict over the statutory audit jurisdiction. The jurisdictional dispute dragged on for two decades because of the complexity of the Danish regulatory system, where audit regulation takes place in overlapping committees between the profession, the state and the educational institutions. It was finally settled by educational differentiation of the two groups, and we discuss the implications of this settlement for the process of audit harmonisation in Europe. © 2011 European Accounting Association.",,,"Jeppesen, K.

The target of our analysis is constituted by the thoughts of sophisticated users of financial statements when reflecting about International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) implementation in Europe. Drawing on the work of Mary Douglas on purity and Michel Foucault on docility, it is argued and shown that sophisticated users tend to interpret aberrations - that is to say indications of incomparability which confront users in the flow of their professional lives - in ways that allow the ideal of comparability to be preserved. Important consequences ensuing from the docility of users in purifying aberrations are discussed. © 2011 European Accounting Association.",,,"Durocher, S.; Telfer School of Management, 55 Laurier Est, Ottawa, ON, K1N 6N5, Canada; email: durocher@telfer.uOttawa.ca",,,09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

From the perspective of the whole organization, each budgeting alternative improves profits. I then examine the department preferences for each alternative when each function is under the control of a different department and each department has its own, department-specific perfdepartment preferences for each alternative when each function is under the control of a different department and each department has its own, department-specific performance metric. Forecasting is judged on the variance of the base demand forecast, operational planning on the expected unit capacity costs and performance evaluation on the salesperson's expected action.

In this paper, we focus on two of accounting's key functions within organisations and markets, financial reporting and governance. In this respect, we find that accounting exhibited shortcomings in its structural foundation and in its application. Salient is its failure to account for uncertainty and to adequately capture, measure and disclose the impact of risk-taking on the financial statements, thus undermining their reliability and, potentially, their relevance as indicators of economic performance. Consequently, boards were provided with misleading numbers, and compensation was based on paper profits that did not materialise. As such, accounting carried undesirable elements that interacted with other malicious market characteristics such as excessive risk-taking by bankers, and failure in regulatory and market oversight, thus potentially contributing to deteriorating economic conditions.

Using Swedish data, we document the accounting consequences of the adoption of IFRS 3 and the stock market's reaction. After the adoption of this standard in January 2005 the amount of capitalized goodwill increased substantially. Goodwill impairments under IFRS are considerably lower than goodwill amortizations and impairments made under Swedish GAAP. Consequently, the adoption of IFRS 3 increased reported earnings. An analysis of economic incentives influencing the impairment decision at the initial adoption of IFRS 3 shows that tenured management is negatively associated with the impairment decision. However, most firms did not reclassify goodwill or make additional impairments. Firms with substantial amounts of goodwill yielded abnormally high returns despite abnormally low earnings. Investors seem to, correctly or incorrectly, have viewed the accrual-based increase in earnings stemming from IFRS 3 as an indication of higher future cash flows. © 2011 European Accounting Association.",,,"Hamberg, M.; Department of Accounting, Auditing and Law, , 5045 Bergen, Norway; email: mattias.hamberg@nhh.no",,,09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

Our results document a negative relation between both aspects of the ultimate ownership structure and timely loss recognition. Our results are consistent with two possible explanations. First, as the controlling owner's stake in the company increases, a smaller portion of the firm's financing needs will be provided by minority shareholders. Minority shareholders do not have access to the company's private information, but demand timely recognition of losses into earnings to protect their claim. Reducing the role of minority shareholders implies also lower demand for timely loss recognition. Second, the results are consistent with an increase in the ownership stake of the controlling owner or in the divergence between the controlling owner's voting and cash flow rights leading to an increase in managerial incentives to share information with the controlling shareholder, reducing the demand for timely loss recognition for monitoring purposes. © 2011 European Accounting Association.",,,"Bona-sánchez, C.; Department of Finance and Accounting, , 35017 Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain; email: cbona@defc.ulpgc.es",,,09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

In recent years however, alternative approaches to management control such as the Balanced Scorecard have been launched. It has even been suggested that organizations should drop the budget and move 'Beyond Budgeting' (Hope and Fraser, Strategic Finance, 82(4), pp. 30-35, 2000). New approaches to management control attempt to respond to the shortcomings of budgets, such as being time consuming and focused on cost reduction rather than value creation. While the Balanced Scorecard and Beyond Budgeting appear to be more closely connected to firm strategy, we know little about how such alternative management control systems function in practice and potential challenges of these new systems. This study is a first step in that direction. We examine 'Beyond Budgeting' in practice by focusing on how corporate level in a large multidivisional oil and energy company adopted this new approach to management control and how it was implemented in two business units. Specifically we investigate: (a) the rules of action that are developed in the absence of budgets; and (b) how the new management control system is expected to influence interaction patterns. Drawing on agency and resource dependency theory in our analysis, our findings indicate that the means of control that are exercised in the absence of budgets alter the relationship between corporate management and division management and new lines of dependency are created between divisions. © 2011 European Accounting Association.",,,"Østergren, K.; NHH Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration, Helleveien 30, 5045, Bergen, Norway; email: katarina.ostergren@nhh.no",,,09638180,,,,"English","Eur.

The aim is not only to provide some input to young researchers who are going to publish good research using analytical methods, but also to give some hints to help users of analytical accounting research to understand and interpret the findings of this type of research. Ohlson has taken on a task of identifying a set of critical factors which are likely to lead to successful research. Good research is defined as research that makes an impression. Thus, it is not enough to get the research published - not even in a premier journal. The research should have an impact, the community should learn something. As Ohlson notes, there is enough 'ordinary' research. In my view this is the right attitude. Shortterm optimization is also widespread in the research community and that is not what we should strive for. With the objective in place, I will continue to analyze the question in relation to analytical research. I start out discussing the aim of analytical research by providing a few examples of good models. The first is the Feltham-Ohlson model and the second is the agency model. Both are simple and elegant models dealing with difficult issues. The analysis proceeds to characterize good models. A good model is a simple model that zooms in on the problem under scrutiny. It is a 'minimal' model that contains the problem and nothing outside the problem. I then proceed to characterize good research in an analytical framework. This is research that tackles a problem that is of interest to the users and the researcher. In this process I also identify current notable analytical research. Finally, I contrast this to the recommendations of Ohlson. © 2011 European Accounting Association.",,,"Christensen, J.; Department of Business and Economics, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; email: jcn@sam.sdu.dk",,,09638180,,,,"English","Eur.
