# TOPIC-MODEL
## Tutorial on Topic Modelling using R.

This course demonstrates how to apply the textual analysis technique called Topic Modelling to infer latent topics from a corpus of textual documents. Topic Modelling includes a series of unsupervised machine learning algorithms aiming to uncover latent topics in a corpus of documents by identifying clusters of words that are likely to co-occur in the corpus. R statistical packages will be used to apply the methodology on a corpus of papers published in an academic journal over the last 10 years. The analysis will allow to identify the topics mostly covered, their prevalence (proportion) in each document, the words mostly related to each topic, and the effects of some determinants on topic prevalence using a regression framework.
During the workshop we will:
1.	Import textual data into R (abstracts, titles and key words of papers published over the last 10 years in a freely chosen academic journal).
2.	Pre-process textual data to get it ready for topic modelling.
3.	Estimate the topic model using the R package topmicmodels for Latent Dirichlet Allocation and R package stm for Structural Topic Modelling.
4.	Analyse and visualize the results from the calculated models using several R packages.

Prerequisites: no previous knowledge of statistical programming is needed, although previous experience with a statistical package (e.g., R, Python, STATA, SPSS, SAS, etc.) will help. The course will be taught fully in English, although the professor can also answer questions in Catalan, Italian and Spanish. Participants are recommended to install both R and R Studio, before the first session, from the following web pages:

1.	R installation: https://cloud.r-project.org/.
2.	R Studio Desktop (Free) installation: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/.
