By means of an in-depth historical case study, we demonstrate how elite strategists mobilized networks and symbolic capital to disrupt field relations and embed the US community foundation model of philanthropy in North East England. Our findings suggest that instead of simply copying alien field-level practices, strategic actors within the philanthropic field adapted and modified them to deliver fit-for-context change legitimated by support from the regional power elite. Our main contribution is to show how strategic elites drawn from different life-worlds build coalitions within the field of power to modify institutional infrastructures and embed innovative organizational models, simultaneously bolstering their legitimacy and symbolic capital.

At first glance the links between Polanyi's ideas about markets, society and institutions and strategy may not be obvious. However, there is a hereto unrecognised link between recent writing about institutions and strategy and Polanyi's work. In this paper we, therefore, chart how, when recognised, these links reveal that Karl Polanyi's work might provide new ways of thinking about strategy. Our over-riding claim is that Polanyi's ideas reveal the importance of considering how strategies are defined, responded to, and ultimately rendered effective or ineffective in ways that are determined by relationships between markets, the state and society. It is thus crucial to understand strategy as embedded, this implying consideration of a strategy's legitimacy in economy and society as an instituted process at any particular place and time. This also implies wider political questions about strategy in society and the extent to which strategists need to be aware of the ‘double movement’ Polanyi discusses and ensure strategies serve the interests of society as well as those of the market. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Double movement; Globalization; Law firms; Polanyi; Strategy",,"Faulconbridge, J.R.; Department of Organisation, United Kingdom; email: j.faulconbridge@lancaster.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Using Buddhist theoretical concepts of ‘form’ (rūpa), ‘space’ and ‘emptiness’ (suññatā), and ‘stream’ (sota) of ‘re-becoming’ (punabbhava), this paper argues that perceived dominant or hegemonic ‘forms’ are inherently transient and ephemeral (anicca) because they are continually emptied of ‘self’ (anattā) by confluent ‘flows’ of practice which course in ‘spaces’ within, through and around these ‘forms’ and constantly dis-aggregate and re-aggregate them in variegated ways. The paper exemplifies this importance of ‘flows’ of practice in ‘empty spaces’ in terms of a case-study of transformation from Buddhist cosmologically-premised tax-accounts to commercialised tax-accounts based around Chinese trading practices in mid-19th century Siam/Thailand. The paper analyses the nature of this Siamese accounting transformation or stream of ‘re-becoming’ in terms of the confluent flow of different cosmological and commercial accounting practices, and argues in consequence for the impermanent and transient nature of dominant or hegemonic accounting structures and formations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Buddhism; Form/space; Stream of re-becoming; Thailand",,"Kuasirikun, N.; University of Manchester, United Kingdom; email: nooch.kuasirikun@manchester.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

This study extends prior studies on NGO accountability by showing the potency of accounting in enabling governments to use the pretext of visibility to indirectly achieve an outcome – curbing activism – similar to that resulting from the direct prohibition of foreign funding. It examines how an accounting regulation was utilised to discipline human rights organisations (HROs) and their members of staff by using the case of the ‘foreign agents’ law in Russia. This accounting regulation abruptly changed accounting for foreign funding to stigmatise HROs and influence their political activism. More specifically, the ‘foreign agents’ law: created a new group of governable objects by labelling them as ‘NGOs performing the functions of a foreign agent’ to distinguish them from other types of NGOs; encumbered NGOs with costly reporting requirements; and empowered government authorities to discipline ‘deviant NGOs’ and their employees. The threat of inspections, penalties, damaged reputations and spoiled identities through public shaming campaigns and negative publicity not only resulted in a substantial reduction in human rights activism but also led to the demise of Russian HROs and human rights defenders. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Accounting regulation; Disciplinary power; Foreign funding restrictions; Human rights organisations",,"Goncharenko, G.; Department of Accounting and Finance, United Kingdom; email: g.goncharenko@sussex.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Combining document analysis and interviews with key participants, we develop what Lyotard (1984) terms as a petit récit or little narrative, which offers a paralogical evaluation of the tragedy based on dissensus, incorporating conflicting multiple perspectives that suggest the deep-seated nature of accounting constructs in the design of catastrophe.

The analysis utilises a financialisation framing, whereby the practices, logics and measurements of finance capital, increasingly permeate government, institutional and household behaviour and discourse. This paper examines how housing associations have increasingly resorted to corporate bond finance, partly in response to reductions in government funding, and in the process engaged with CRAs. Surprisingly little research has been undertaken on the role and function of CRAs, and their impact on the organisations they rate. The case of housing associations (HAs) is of particular interest, given their historical social mission to build and manage properties to meet housing need, rather than operate as commercial private landlords conversant with market-based rationales. A case study of the large London-based HAs draws on a narrative and financial analysis of annual reports, supplemented by semi-structured interviews with senior HA finance officers to explore how CRA methodologies have been internalised and have contributed to changes in strategic and operational activities. We conclude that CRAs act both as a gatekeeper to the financial markets but also as a gateway constructor for the financial markets to enter new arenas, such as the HA sector. This dual nature of CRAs is intended as our contribution to emerging debates about the nature, the practice and the impact of financialisation on public services. © 2019 The Authors","Corporate bonds; Credit rating agencies; Financialisation; Social housing",,"Smyth, S.; Sheffield University Management School, Conduit Road, United Kingdom; email: s.j.smyth@sheffield.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Specifically, it uses Goffman's (1959, 1963) writings on stigma and presentation of self and Benoit's (1995) image restoration theory to explore how a large mining company in Tanzania used various strategic responses in striving to distance and dissociate itself from the attached ‘stigma’. The evidence shows that, in response to attacks from pressure-group organisations, rather than apologising for the social and environmental crises, the company was preocupied with ‘defensive stigma management’ strategies, including denial and refocusing attention, evading responsibility, image bolstering, excuses and dissociation. Drawing on our findings, we argue that, rather than making the effects of stigma more visible, accounting and CSR disclosures were mobilised to conceal the threats of stigma, manage the legitimacy crisis and repair spoiled identity.

We investigate whether banks in Bangladesh embrace CSR practices to follow the regulatory guidelines issued by the central bank or if they develop CSR practices opportunistically and politically. We provide evidence from 21 semi-structured interviews with managers of banks in Bangladesh and from published sources. The findings indicate that CSR activities are prompted by: CSR regulations by the central bank (Bangladesh Bank); congruency between banks’ goals and the regulator; support offered by the central bank; and the quest to maintain effective relationships with other stakeholders, such as the government and political leaders. The findings also show that CSR practices become decoupled from regulatory expectations and that managers ‘dress up’ reported information by bypassing regulatory guidelines when responding to demands from powerful stakeholders, such as board members and political elites. Banks do not respond aggressively to CSR regulation, for example, with challenges and attack-type responses, as these responses are culturally unacceptable. The findings imply that decoupling occurs, and that it is unlikely that regulation will minimize this behaviour because there is a lack of political will, an absence of accountability and there appears to be a lack of substantive commitment ethical conduct amongst powerful board members. Despite regulatory efforts, we find that exploitative practices continue in line with cultural norms in the banking environment in Bangladesh. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bangladesh; Banks; CSR practices; CSR regulations; Institutional influences; Strategic responses",,"Khan, H.Z.; Discipline of Accounting and Finance, Australia; email: Habib.Khan@canberra.edu.au",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

This analysis is developed through an interpretive case study of EDP, the largest Portuguese group in the electricity sector. Our empirical material includes CEO communications in the media from 2010 to 2014, and is interpreted through a theoretical framework derived from institutional theory, developed by complementing Oliver (1991) strategic responses to institutional pressures with the verbal accounts as defined by Elsbach (1994). The study highlights the country-level institutional structures, the organisations’ own characteristics and the power of the constituents involved in the process as important predictors of responses in a complex environment. EDP strategically resisted institutional pressures as it negotiated among competing forces of institutional control, delaying partial compliance to coercive pressures and using time as a resource for organisation actions. EDP's strategies reinforce the argument that organisations may consider unconditional compliance with broader stakeholder interests unacceptable when the profit logic is called into question before the dominance of the neo-liberal capitalist ideology. We have rendered visible the consequences of the project of neoliberalisation and the agenda of state privatisation of the European Union, resulting in a simple redistribution of resources towards shareholders and investors, to the disadvantage of other groups in society. © 2019","CEO communications; Electricity sector; Institutional complexity; Strategic responses",,"Martins, A.; University of Minho, Campus de Gualtar, Portugal; email: adelaide@eeg.uminho.pt",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

During the last two decades, the intellectual capital school of thought has produced numerous measurement frameworks and models for capturing the intangible bases of value creation, which currently occupy a well-established position in academia. In this paper, we argue that something important might have been lost along the way, namely, a thorough understanding of knowledge as the basis for human and organizational productive behavior. We argue that in order to remain relevant in the face of the increasing knowledge intensity of work, organizing, and value creation, the measurements of intellectual capital (IC) should revisit the foundations of what knowledge is. In order to regain this understanding, this paper draws on a knowledge-based perspective and proposes four critical themes that should be better recognized in IC measurement: multi-dimensionality, human agency and action, contextuality, and temporality and dynamics. We discuss the challenges that each theme poses for IC measurement and construct a set of criteria and applications for a more adequate measurement of IC. © 2018 The Authors","Critical; Intellectual capital; Knowledge; Measurement",,"Kianto, A.; School of Business and Management, P.O.

We examine how IC is reported under each of these frameworks and conclude that <IR> is unlikely to subsume traditional financial statement reporting, nor will it be able to provide all the information currently reported in GRI-type reports. The interplay of these reporting frameworks and their future development bodes well for IC, because different kinds of IC information will be reported under each of <IR>, GRI-type reports and in financial statements; that is IC does not compete with these forms of reporting forms, but forms an essential part of each. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Critical perspective; Integrated reporting; Intellectual capital",,"de Villiers, C.; Graduate School of Management, New Zealand; email: charl.devilliers@auckland.ac.nz",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

In other words, what role does time play in IC-related management accounting practices? Alvesson and Deetz's (2000) critical management research framework was selected for the examination. The temporal dimensions of IC and its related measurement and management accounting processes are discussed and questioned from a time-oriented micro-process (practice) perspective. The main findings are the following. First, IC can be considered as a “temporal boundary object”. Second, the development of IC time-related indicators for IC should be problematized to increase understanding. Moreover, this study lends sharp focus to the need for considering more than just the amount of time spent engaging in IC activities, but the quality of that time as well. Third, we confirm that IC tends to change over time. Consequently, IC concepts, methods and tools are not stable in practice, but rather are reflective of a specific time horizon. Forth, time-lags relating to IC creation and development tend to be overlooked and, hence, are not as clearly understood. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Accounting; Intellectual capital; Sensemaking; Time",,"Giuliani, M.; Department of Management, P.le Martelli 8, Italy; email: m.giuliani@univpm.it",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The aim of this assistance is to strengthen the democratic role of the WCs in firms. The purpose of this research is to examine whether and how the PAs’ assistance to WCs leads to the emergence of a form of agonistic democracy by contributing to an evolution in firms’ uses of accounting. We conducted a qualitative study with 36 semi-structured interviews with both PAs and WC members. Our results indicate that, under certain circumstances, the assistance provided by PAs can support dialogue between the WC members (“laypersons”) and the managers (“experts”) in WCs, which can be viewed as “hybrid forums” (open spaces where heterogeneous groups come together to debate socio-technical choices). The confrontation between different ideological orientations that inevitably arises can contribute to a dialogic use of accounting, which is promising for developing an agonistic democracy within organizations. However, PA assistance to a WC must be carefully handled because of the risk that managers will instrumentalize it. When this happens, accounting is still used in a monologic (as opposed to dialogic) form in firm management. The risk is that genuine participation by WC members remains illusory. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agonistic democracy; Dialogic tool; Public accountants; Works councils",,"Nègre, E.2 rue du Doyen Gabriel Marty, France; email: emmanuelle.negre@tsm-education.fr",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

From a theoretical viewpoint, the work is grounded on the notion of the common good as expressed by ancient philosophers, among whom Aquinas played a prominent role. We adopted an ethnographic approach and a longitudinal analysis to deepen the case of Alpine collective ownership (CO). This type of organisation can be classified in the non-profit domain because it manages Alpine territories without directly benefitting the members in monetary terms. CO is a non-profit organisation 'oriented to values and beliefs' and the common good notion is embedded in the mission. The focus is on the ability of the CO's accountability to shape a renewed notion of the common good in order to engage the community in managing CO's properties. The CO's accountability shows that: (a) the definition of the common good is reshaped; (b) there is a continuous call for engagement; (c) financial data become ancillary to the disclosed information; and (d) information on new social and environmental needs is disclosed. The study shows that accountability is a protean concept where a key issue is the language used (i.e., local spoken language versus the national language). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Alpine collective ownership; Common good; Engagement; Language",,"Pesci, C.; University of Trento, Via Inama, 5, Italy; email: caterina.pesci@unitn.it",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

This corporate form provides entities endeavoring to act in the public interest access to markets and investment capital alongside compatible governance processes. Since the initial state adoption of this form in 2010, 34 states have enacted BC legislation. Our empirical investigation demonstrates and assesses the emergence and evolution of this hybrid corporate form by articulating the discursive framings of a constellation of actors in and around these legislative enactments. The discursive framing is dynamic and contested over time, evolving from a focus on enabling for-profit firms to broaden out their objectives to include social goals beyond profit maximization to a focus on exposing activities traditionally carried out by government or not-for-profit entities to market discipline. One interpretation of the findings is that BCs are a manifestation and means by which the responsibility for public services and public welfare is transferred to the private sector along with the associated public resources. We consider the implications of a shifting landscape of corporate governance and accountability regimes for public welfare objectives. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Benefit corporations; Corporate governance; Discursive framing; Public interest",,"Baudot, L.; Kenneth G.

In an ex-post attempt to address this malaise and restore confidence in the sector, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) affirmed, in its mission statement, a strong commitment to serving the public interest. We appraise the FCA's public interest rhetoric and contrast the term public interest with its antecedent, the common good. In so doing, we conclude that the common good is superior to the public interest insofar as the former incorporates a moral dimension which is absent from the latter. Moreover, the common good embraces an inclusivity in its altruism that renders it superior to the majoritarism of the public interest. Thereafter, we illuminate the concept of the common good by drawing on Bernard Lonergan's philosophical anthropology and, in particular, his cognitive structure of dynamic knowing. Finally, we provide a discourse for the banking sector which incorporates Lonergan's philosophy as a mechanism for conceptualising accounting and accountability for the common good. We argue for a new focus to liberate banking from self-interested desires, embedded in a neoliberal ideology, and redirect it towards a compassionate caring culture. © 2018","Accountability; Common good; Lonergan; Public interest",,"Ballantine, J.; Ulster University Business School, Jordanstown Campus, Shore Road, Ireland; email: joan.ballantine@ulster.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Grounded in a person-oriented approach, we contend the common good principle can help accountants to mitigate the tyranny of economic rationality/homo economicus notably through greater consideration of public interest, thereby enabling them to exercise stronger ethical judgement. First, the common good can serve as a basis for the establishment of an ethical protocol based on the search for embedded community goods, human development and the personal good of each member. Second, the common good provides specific ethical principles including subsidiarity, totality, teleological hierarchy, long-term commitment, reality and unity that can better assist accounting professionals to exercise ethical judgement and therefore contribute to the public interest. In contrast to defending a strict adherence to ethical rules enshrined in professional codes of conduct, this article argues for an open ended protocol inspired by the common good principle. This will, we contend, better promote the re-contextualisation of accounting practices conducted by reflexive, sentient and publically-conscious practitioners. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Catholic social teaching; Common good; Public interest; Scientification",,"Puyou, F.-R.; University of St Andrews, The Gateway, St Andrews, United Kingdom; email: frp2@st-andrews.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The accountancy profession claims that these policies serve the public interest. Drawing on public interest theory, the paper examines how the profession has defined and limited the public interest via, and in relation to, CPD and the implications of the CPD policies when considering the profession's claims to serve the public interest. The CPD policies of twelve professional accountancy bodies are reviewed. This reveals multiple dualisms (input or output, relevant to profession or relevant to current role, individual or employer-focused) and broad spectra (from more reflective to more prescribed and from core to peripheral accounting fields) resulting in multiple permutations that render CPD difficult to conceptualise. The result is that CPD in the accountancy profession exhibits contradictions that result in policies that are logically incoherent. The blurred distinction between a professional accountant's responsibility as a member of a profession and as a person carrying out an occupational role limits the scope of CPD to adequately protect the public interest. © 2018 The Authors","Accountancy profession; Continuing professional development; Professional accountant; Public interest",,"Paisey, C.; Accounting and Finance Subject Group, United Kingdom; email: catriona.paisey@glasgow.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Previous accounting studies of disasters have demonstrated how accounts play a pivotal role in defining questions of justice and accountability – to whom and for what?

We argue that the common good, evaluated through logic and reasoning within a ‘situation’ or social reality, is multiple.

To address this gap, a study examined how financial accountants acquire the entity-specific information used in producing financial statements and how they deal with the uncertainty that the situation entails. The study examines cases of implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards, considers the new kinds of entity-specific information the standards require, and argues that the most critical issue in such implementation is that the accountants grow more dependent on the business managers’ knowledge. The paper describes how the case firms’ accountants responded to the necessity of ‘opening up’ the business perspective by adopting models (from a consulting firm) that took on a vital role in organising financial statements’ production and rendered it more manageable. These models need not actually lay bare the business perspective as the business managers understand it; rather, they help the accountants maintain and negotiate task boundaries related to financial reporting. The study argues that the outcome (or possible outcomes) of financial reporting play an important part in controlling this production, and the accountants actively used them as a resolution tool when the business side was unable or unwilling to give a ‘clear view’ of the business operations. © 2020 The Author","Accountants' jurisdiction; Boundary objects; Entity-specific information; Infrastructure; International Financial Reporting Standards; Profit; Valuation Technologies",,,,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Our data comprises a combination of 29 semi-structured interviews, field observations and archival evidence. We reveal how western-originated CG and accountability reforms are constrained or subverted by a vigorous neo-patrimonial regime. The Kenyan corporate sector has well defined legal-rational structures, including an elaborate corporate sector regulatory framework, professionals (i.e. accountants and auditors) and corporate boards. In contrast, however, informal networks and patronage interfere with the nomination and work of non-executive board members, thereby hindering the possibility of an independent monitoring of executive management. A conflictual and inadequately resourced regulatory framework plays a more symbolic than an effective regulative role in enforcing CG and accountability practices. We also find a widespread rent-seeking culture that significantly hinders the exercise of corporate accountability. Furthermore, external auditor independence is problematic due to conflicts of interest and the auditors’ dependence on advisory fees, thereby favouring a clientelist association with auditee firms.

However, the ways in which auditing can be used as a tool of resistance to the neoliberal order remains underexplored. The present paper contributes to the auditing literature by studying the case of the public debt renegotiation of Ecuador (2007–2009), in which the government specifically resorted to an audit of its public debt when it tried to renegotiate, at its advantage, an important cutback of said debt; a debt to which neoliberal measures have been tied. By examining the ways auditing was mobilized by the Ecuadorian government and the reactions of financial market actors to the debt audit, this paper provides insights into the role that auditing can play in society as a device of political resistance. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Accountability; Audit; Emotions; Legitimacy; Neoliberalism; Public debt; Resistance",,,,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

However, the notion that such innovation offers a softer or more benign finance is debated. In this paper we examine one recent innovation, social impact bonds (SIBs), and through a case study, we evaluate policy documents, press releases, interim reports and interviews with 4 key stakeholders in a recent UK SIB. In doing so, we contend that the case SIB embedded modalities of neoliberal governance further into contemporary social care and social relations. We argue that social investment is thus based around a model of inclusive neoliberalism and that the apparent innovations in social investment further embed finance and extractive logic deeper into social life.

On the other hand, those who deliver healthcare can extract financial value from the system. Cost-based prices are now potent measures of financial value for profit centres in English hospitals. Here, we focus on the ramifications of these cost-based prices for creating or extracting value in the health care system. Our empirical data is drawn from: first, semi-structured interviews with Clinical Directors who head up profit centres in English hospitals; and, second, documentary sources which reveal how accounting drives costing for health treatments. From these data sources we identify three valuing activities which mobilise cost-based prices: “bubble” charts; “up-coding” and business cases in the context of a joint venture. We conclude that cost-based pricing can create public value because it incentivizes clinical activity and can be used to enhance health care quality. But the traditional accounting mode for cost-based pricing advantages standardised care while disadvantaging complex care, this generates opportunities for value extraction for those, including some private sector providers, who deliver standardised care. Our analysis encompasses three different levels: the profit centre based on a specialty, the hospital and the entire health care system. This broad appraisal reveals that value creation at the level of the individual profit centre can become value extraction for the hospital and the health care system as a whole. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Healthcare; Price; Privatization; Value creation; Value extraction; Valuing",,"Llewellyn, S.; The University of Manchester, United Kingdom; email: sue.llewellyn@manchester.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

First, it assesses existing local accounting and financial reporting practices in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), focusing on the extent to which recent government financial statements published by ten selected countries adhere to mainstream qualitative features of public sector reporting. Second, it investigates the multiple institutional logics at play in the context of government accounting reforms (GARs) in SSA, involving international organisations, epistemic community members, policy makers and local actors. Data for the study are drawn from a content analysis and disclosure scoring of ten SSA government financial statements, supplemented by forty semi-structured interviews carried out in Nigeria and Tanzania. Our findings demonstrate how the generalised assumptive logics of international organisations, coupled with the market and professional logics of epistemic community members and state logics of local politicians, have led to the marginalisation of ‘good’ existing accounting and financial reporting practice in SSA (as reflected by the extent to which government financial statements adhere to mainstream features of public sector reporting) - while providing the countries with a strong impetus for undertaking a transition towards large-scale GARs involving accrual accounting and IPSASs. The role of the epistemic community in selectively ignoring the positive aspects of local accounting practice is a significant impediment. In this way, members of this epistemic community continue to execute their ‘relational power’ generated through professional knowledge, expertise and elite connections over the local actors, hence upholding the generalised assumptive logics. The paper argues that public accountability and transparency can be strengthened in SSA countries provided there is an ‘intelligent’ application of existing regulations and accounting systems, rather than seeking to merely replace them with externally imposed large-scale GARs. © 2020","Epistemic community; Government accounting reforms; Institutional logics; Sub-Sahara Africa",,"Jayasinghe, K.; Essex Business School (EBS), Wivenhoe Park, United Kingdom; email: knjay@essex.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Additionally, it is often argued that when women are involved in leadership positions, they can transform inequality by highlighting and reversing practices that marginalise women, but whether this happens in practice is overlooked in the accounting literature. In this study we begin to address these gaps by using Huffman's (Huffman, 2016) conceptualisation of women leaders as agents of change or cogs in the machine to articulate the role and impact of a Nigerian female body of accountants on inequality in the Nigerian accounting profession. Our findings reveal a complex scenario showing that while women leaders may transform inequality positively, underlying sociocultural pressures have the potential to divert and subvert long run change. Thus, our findings suggest that either women leaders play a transitory role in transforming gender inequality in the accounting profession and society, or that their role becomes transitory if focus on the original emancipatory objectives is lost. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,,"Ogharanduku, B.E.; Sheffield Business School, Howard St, United Kingdom; email: b.ogharanduku@shu.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Nine hospital departments were chosen to change their management control system from a strict top-down productivity focus to a locally developed performance measurement system based on a patient focus. Thus, the management control system was changed with the aim of enhancing the social impact of the provided hospital services by integrating a patient focus. The paper portrays a three-year evolution through management narratives. Findings evidence initial embracement of the project followed by gradual operational management discouragement due to external productivity pressures and internal data issues. Despite these challenges, the regional management highlighted the project as a success and expanded it to the remaining departments. Thus, we find that the project became decoupled rather than institutionalized due to a sustained productivity logic. Through the lens of institutional theory, we argue that a decoupling of the patient focused project happens because of a surprisingly strong institutionalized productivity logic. We suggest that in this context of strong coupling of previous systems, organizations may paradoxically engage in decoupling practices that are intended to support their professional core practices but instead protect the administrative logic of efficiency and productivity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Critical study; Hospital; Institutional Theory; Performance measures; Quality",,"Malmmose, M.; Department of Management, Fuglesangsalle 4, Denmark; email: mmalmmose@mgmt.au.dk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Adopting a governmentality approach, we analyse interview data, in the UK and Australia, to query how power guides the willing subjectivity of senior executives to provide an account of tax performance that is aligned to institutional investor information expectations, given tax complexity. At this interface between financial reporting and tax regulation, disciplinary power, when combined with regulatory fear, routinize the production of simplified, plausible but sanitised stories. This provides institutional investors with what they need to know while avoiding the risk of attracting the attention of the tax regulator but limits the value of the information flow. Furthermore, mutually consensual, self-disciplining dramaturgical rituals between executives and institutional investors allow complex tax issues to be glossed over to focus on other more comfortable, productive areas of corporate performance.

We show how it develops new inter-organisational management controls by selectively coupling its private sector and public sector logics at the organisational level, while at the individual level institutionally embedded organisational actors, drawing on social identities which enact societal-level logics, can impede (and possibly subvert) these controls. For this purpose, we develop a conceptual framework by drawing on the institutional logics perspective, and especially microfoundations provided by Thornton and her colleagues, which recognises institutional logics at various levels and highlights the importance of social identity and embedded agency. We argue that, rather than implementing the ‘best practices’ from developed countries, research should look for African solutions which build on and adapt traditional institutional logics and practices. © 2020","Institutional logics; Inter-organisational relationships; Management controls; Public organisations; Sub-Saharan Africa",,"Rozenfeld, G.C.; University of Birmingham, United Kingdom; email: G.C.Rozenfeld@bham.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The literature on commercialism in auditing addresses the question of how it has been institutionalized and legitimized at the macro-level of the accounting field (e.g., Cooper & Robson, 2006; Guo, 2016; Malsch & Gendron, 2013; Suddaby et al., 2007). However, this literature does not explore the micro-level processes through which auditors justify their own commercialism. Thus, it overlooks the central role that individual subjectivity and interpretation play in the maintenance and transmission of institutional logics (Bévort & Suddaby, 2016; Thornton & Ocasio, 2008). In our view, this has prevented accounting scholars from developing a more meaningful conceptualization of the relationship between auditors’ commercialism and their professionalism, one that goes beyond the apparently clashing imperatives of these two logics. The findings of our study suggest that the positive values auditors attribute to the logic of commercialism blur the distinction between their commercial and their professional commitments, so that the notion of a fundamental conflict between their commercialism and their public interest mission comes to be seen as almost absurd. Overall, our analysis of the ways that professionalism and commercialism intertwine with each other in auditors’ daily lives suggests that the relationship between these two logics is much more complex than previously assumed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Accounting profession; Commercialism; Discursive legitimation; professionalism",,,,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Through a distinction the paper develops between what are termed the corporate imaginary and human sentience, it contrasts two very different notions of the nature of boundaries. As ‘imaginary’ financial accounting plays a key role in the constitution of the corporation as an entity, indifferent to what lies beyond the corporate boundary save for that which accounting makes play upon its own economic interests. Accounting is also key in making a reality of the economic imaginary of the self; the atomistic conception of the individual as a self-interested and opportunistic ‘individual’. In an attempt to illustrate the ‘meconnaisance’ or misrecognition involved in such imaginaries the paper draws on the phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty, Levinas and Irigaray as these inform Butler's recent explorations of human sentience. Each recalls us to the different dimensions of our material embodiment in the world as humans, and with this the nature of boundaries only as space of forgotten relation, exchange and dependence in which we are always acted upon as we act. The paper concludes by suggesting that both ‘core’ and ‘peripheral’ accounting researchers now share the urgent task of finding ways to refashion the limited and purely economic ‘sensibility’ that financial accounting affords the corporate entity, in order to make it responsive to the needs of sentient humans. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Boundary; Butler; Financial accounting; Levinas: Irigaray: Imaginary; Merleau-Ponty",,,,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

(2) Although tension between multiple centers is typical across disciplines in their endeavor to create disciplinary identity, their existence is related to paradigmatic divides. (3) Problems related to excessive gatekeeping arise to protect the reputation of the dominant center. (4) The complexity of today's societal and environmental challenges calls for an interdisciplinary approach. My concluding remarks develop the idea that, if bridges cannot be built across paradigmatic divides, tensions can be harnessed productively by nurturing academic empathy.

To do so, it conducts an in-depth analysis of two contrasting Nigerian public service organizational cases, in which there was an ostensible search for improvements in financial governance. While one of the cases indicates how accounting colonization involved change through an ostensibly coercive accounting design, the other case organization employed budget assurances to deliver public service consistent with an ostensibly more emancipatory design. In both cases, instrumental compliance with the accounting design did not occur during implementation as a devious compliance took hold. Consequently, the delivery of priorities was not exactly as intended. This study contributes to the theorising of emancipatory/oppressive accounting, including vis-à-vis accounting colonization, by providing evidence of both the coercive and emancipatory dimensions of accounting design in this context.

It draws upon a broad set of Bourdieu's concepts, comprising field, capital, doxa and habitus alongside the use of grounded theory methods to code and categorise the empirical data. Data was collected from eleven NGOs, selected to provide a comparative set, encompassing national, NGO type and religious affiliation. A contextual field analysis revealed the dominance of Northern NGOs, resulting from their ownership and control of capital, in influencing accountability perceptions and the importance of legitimacy. An organisational analysis revealed the importance of habitus and doxa underpinning conceptions and practices of accountability and accounting, to emerge. It also enabled the identification of ‘existential doxa’ and ’accountability doxa’ which provided the link between the field and the accountability habitus to be understood. The resulting understanding explains accounting and accountability practices as resulting from strategies adopted in response to the accountability habituses, underpinned by doxa, which themselves are responses to the contexts with in which the NGOs operate. The context comprises the field within which NGOs struggle for capital resources, alongside existential choices made by the NGOs themselves. © 2020 The Author(s)","Accountability; Africa; Bourdieu; NGO accounting",,,,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Grounded accountability is presented to extend the concept of felt accountability that is understood as an ethical affinity between an employee and the goals of operational NGOs that employ them to benefit third parties. Grounded accountability involves devolving responsibility for defining goals to the third parties who can then realise their own self-determination. Grounded accountability is developed with a Māori community indigenous to Aotearoa/New Zealand through their shared whakapapa that views a structured genealogical relationship between all things. Whakapapa suggests that accountability is grounded in kinship, place and intergenerational relationships. An empirical exploration of grounded accountability takes place through an ethnography-informed case study conducted at two levels of investigation. The first is within Ngāi Tahu, a broad kinship grouping, who are pursuing self-determination in the settler-colonial context of Aotearoa/New Zealand. The second is within Te Rūnanga Group, an operational NGO charged with managing and distributing the collective assets resulting from the settlement of grievances against the Crown fought for by Ngāi Tahu in their struggle for self-determination. Evidence of grounded accountability was found within Ngāi Tahu and although this has been transmitted to some practices within Te Rūnanga Group, other practices constrain grounded relationships. To the extent that grounded accountability exists, through the design of an organization based on the values of primary stakeholders and continuous engagement with those stakeholders over time, it overcomes some potential limitations of perpetuating beneficiary dependency inherent in felt accountability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Accountability; Indigenous; Non-governmental organizations; Self-determination",,"Scobie, M.; University of Canterbury, University Drive, Ilam, New Zealand; email: matthew.scobie@canterbury.ac.nz",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Drawing on official documentation and historical data, and focusing on individuals’ lived experiences and biographies captured through in-depth interviews with refugees, this paper demonstrates that by imposing financial obligations to repay transportation costs, the government, with the help of non-governmental organisations, financialises and ‘responsibilises’ individuals, who develop micro-accounting skills throughout the process. The paper contributes to the accounting literature on responsibilisation in neoliberal societies by showing the way in which debt, and its accompanying accounting practices, leads people to become ‘more financially responsible’, while at the same time defining the very meaning of ‘financial responsibility’. By focusing on individuals’ lived experiences, the paper sheds light on some of the means by which accounting shapes people's subjectivity and supports the construction of the neoliberal subject. Notably, this paper demonstrates that the vagueness, inaccuracy, or absence of accounting information responsibilises individuals via the emotions that these features generate.

By examining the role of accounting not at the slave trade's endpoint, e.g., plantations in the Americas, but at its points of extraction, we reveal the role of accounting in commodifying and dehumanizing human beings at a “point of no return”. We add to research that exposes the accounting practices that made humans visible as articles for trade while rendering invisible the innate, human qualities of enslaved Africans. The slave trade relied on methods of physical domination and threats of violence, and we discover these are also part of the accounting portrayed in the archive materials. Given the complex and intricate social relations of the time, we reveal how the mechanisms that attempted to establish accountability between conflicting constituencies (kingdoms, investors, merchants, etc.) were ultimately unstable and challenged but very much focussed on ensuring profit from the trade. Chartered slave trading companies produced sanitized classification schemes in which accounting played a central role in reporting the commerce of enslaved Africans as just another commodity traded under legitimated violence. Issues of racialization and violence continue in this century, thus there remains an important role for accounting researchers to engage with these issues of injustice. © 2020","Accountability; Colonialism; Mercantile capitalism; Racialized accounts; Slave trade",,,,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Different perspectives and indeed voices should be included and a certain egalitarianism sponsored. In a liberal capitalist society this is a good in itself (Rawls, 2009; Appiah, 2017). Surely many would argue this is the role indeed the essence of the University? We readily take up the paper's invitation and are gratified by the professionalism and commitment of the authors. Accounting scholarship, like all parts of liberal capitalist society, requires constant vigilance and reform to approximate these liberal ideas of voice, inclusion, and equal participation.

Rethinking the current structure is important because it is difficult to observe audit quality and to differentiate between functional and dysfunctional commercial incentives of accounting firms. Consequently, it is hard for regulators to determine, and for auditors to demonstrate, whether the profession is acting in the public interest. In this essay, we argue why the current model may be suboptimal and offer thoughts on what may be a more sustainable alternative – from a public interest perspective – to the status quo: An Audit Board. This Audit Board is conceived as a quasi-governmental organization that would conduct financial statement audits for public interest entities. We envision an organization consisting of a core permanent staff of experienced audit experts that is complemented by fellows drawn from the existing accounting firms who take a job at the Board for a certain time period. We presented our proposal to various stakeholders (19 sessions with 108 attendees) to promote debate and to refine our thinking. Our proposal is relevant for regulators in their efforts of motivating auditors to act in the public interest. It would create an entity that is expert in auditing but avoids many of the independence problems faced by for-profit accounting firms. While this proposal certainly deviates from the current model, we hope that it will spark good conversations that may lead to rethinking of the status quo. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Business model; Commercialism; Professionalism; Stakeholder dialogue",,"van Brenk, H.; Nyenrode Business University, Straatweg 25, Netherlands; email: h.vbrenk@nyenrode.nl",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Public housing has been the cornerstone of the welfare state, which perceived housing as a right for all. These housing policies have been challenged from the 1990s onwards, and new legislation introduced in 2011 forced the sector to further economise operations. Because observance of the new legislation supposedly relied on accounting practices, calculative practices became important. The yield metric, which originates in financial economics, became prominent due to its capacity to condense contradictory conditions and time into a single figure, thereby making assets comparable. A study comprising 44 interviews (46 interviewees) undertaken in 9 council-run public housing companies reveals the social impact of the introduced accounting practices. Results indicate that different understandings of the future can either (1) justify bringing residential holdings into a non-calculable sphere to secure political control or (2) result in counter calculations based on assumed future value increases on commercial investments. This vagueness of the notion of time influences the connection between accounting and governmentality and, ultimately, economisation processes since it opens up for political resistance and counter calculations © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Accounting metrics; Calculative practices; Housing; Time, Calculative spheres, Governmentality",,,,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Drawing on the notions of trials (Callon, 1986; Latour, 1987) and criticism in trials (Bourguignon & Chiapello, 2005), we show how the government's attempts in classifying and determining expert roles and responsibilities from engineering, environmental, and financial backgrounds – with a preference for Big 4 accountants in leadership roles – triggered a series of multi-lateral trials of strength and responsibility, and essentially failed to meet its original purpose. By following the regulatory process, we articulate how terminology and measurement devices were mobilised by the regulator to enrol mixed expertise. We also examine how the envisaged identities, roles, and responsibilities were received by lobbyists from the three expert groups, and then how their concern, criticism, and resistance were acted upon and reacted to by the regulator. Our study reveals the dilemma the non-expert government faced in mediating the conflicting interests and goals while fulfilling its regulatory and administrative roles. Our nuanced evidence shows how accounting team leaders role of supervision rather than oversight evoked further controversy.

When a political crisis over the lack of State funding of Catholic education occurred in the early 1960s, neither Church nor State could access the accounting information required to mediate the crisis because they had both selectively chosen to maintain accounting records consistent with their constructed identities even though this meant that their accounting records were not suited to all their needs. This research extends the post-structuralism project in accounting research to the notion of an epistemology of ignorance, which is the intentional choice by a social group to remain ignorant.

Nonetheless, Ekeh's theory needed extending to incorporate changes affecting governance after Benin's independence. The amorality of political officials, accepted by much of Benin society, rendered the institution largely ineffective in controlling corruption. Nevertheless, civil society organizations, donors, and the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have attempted to redress this. Politicians and government officials responded by engaging in symbolic compliance to meet stakeholders’ expectations. A separate audit institution – the General Inspectorate of State – was established under the sole control of the President to gain external legitimacy and retain donors’ budget support, whilst persistent corruption and rising poverty continue.

Legislative documents (particularly Accounting Practice Law 133/1951), regulations and publications were also analysed. Established since 1946, ESAA's initial attempts to embed an ‘Anglo-American’ professional model were curtailed by the newly independent State enabling non-credentialed and relatively less experienced native practitioners to be registered as qualified accountants. The State's influence persisted during the socialist period of nationalisation with a de-emphasising of the accounting profession as an occupational group. The early stages of market capitalism witnessed attempts to re-develop a private-sector-led profession with the support of international organisations, which re-asserted the dominant position of ESAA members. However, government, ESAA and international agencies’ efforts to repeal the original Accounting Practice Law and achieve market closure for the primary benefit of ESAA members were thwarted by political pressure from non-ESAA accountants.

By applying a Foucauldian lens to the analysis of the prison systems of the major Italian States in the early 19th century, the study shows how accounting was an essential aid in ensuring that the correction of individuals was carried out consistent with the moral priorities of the liberal bourgeois society of the time. The specific visibilities created by means of accounting, upon which decisions on the life of prisoners were made and which still characterise modern prisons, reduced human life to a simplistic numerical representation.

There is also evidence of the growing impact of journal ranking lists, with notable upward (downward) trends in the usage of high-ranked (unranked) reference sources. We suggest a link here with recent research on signalling within the publication process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Accounting research; Article construction; Journal rankings; Reference sources",,"Hussain, S.; Newcastle University Business School, 5, Barrack Road, United Kingdom; email: simon.hussain@ncl.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

On the one hand, it might be expected that fossil fuel firms will be less valuable if their reserves become ‘unburnable’. On the other hand, capital markets currently assign a positive value to fossil fuel reserves and resources. A conundrum, therefore, exists. Given that accounting disclosure rules underpin capital market valuation processes, this setting provides an opportunity to interrogate the functionality of accounting during a time of change. To achieve this goal, a multi-methods investigation has been undertaken; combining a survey of accounting disclosure rules for reserves, identification of accounting disclosures made by fuel firms in several country stock markets, and stock market participants’ views on the extent to which unburnable carbon exists. Using Miller and Power (2013) we identify when and how unburnable carbon could be recognized in corporate reporting. © 2019 The Authors","Accounting regulation; Global climate change; Stranded assets; Unburnable carbon",,"Bebbington, J.; Department of Accounting, United Kingdom; email: j.bebbington@bham.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

It is based on interviews with Canadian undergraduates, observations made at recruitment events, and an examination of the recruitment information on the websites of student accounting clubs. The findings show that accounting students’ recruitment illusio—their belief in the seriousness of the recruitment game—is centered on the desire to obtain a Big Four position and that three main factors facilitate the construction of this illusio: the attraction of the career opportunities offered by the Big Four firms, the appeal of the fun and excitement of a Big Four career, and the desire for the social recognition that comes with such a career. This illusio often blinds students to other career choices. However, the findings also show that while students are playing the recruitment game, they evaluate their position in the recruiting field and act strategically to win a position of prestige. Points of disjuncture, such as being rejected by Big Four firms or having a pause from the recruitment game, can allow them to adopt a reflexive stance that weakens their recruitment illusio. The study contributes to the debate on the place of reflexivity in Bourdieu's sociology, to the literature on the socialization of auditors, and to the literature on the commercialization of public accounting. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Big Four accounting firms; Bourdieu; Public accounting recruitment; Reflexivity",,,,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

For Saussure, the relation between sign and referent is always ‘arbitrary’ and, as applied to accounting signification, suggests the impossibility of the seemingly realist ambition of standard setters for accounting to simply ‘faithfully represent’ independently existing ‘economic phenomena’. Instead, for Saussure and Derrida, meaning is purely differential and relational and arises only in the play of difference between signs over time. Following their views on the nature of signification, our account begins with a description of the complex credit derivatives whose rapid shift from profit to loss under fair value triggered the financial crisis. We then explore accounting's participation in the crisis along three dimensions: the collapse of difference between accounting signs that characterised derivatives’ initial construction as profitable, and their later valuation using the ABX.HE index; the self-interested neglect of how fair value accounting signs would interact over time with accounting dependent remuneration practices, credit ratings, and capital adequacy rules; and the introduction of new sources of heterogeneity to accounting in the application of the fair value measurement hierarchy. The paper concludes by suggesting that, in allowing the recognition in the present of values derived from inherently uncertain forward estimates, fair value accounting made possible not the management of risk, but its exploitation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Critical; Fair value accounting; Faithful representation; Financial crisis; Public interest; Saussure and Derrida",,"Wang, T.; Discipline of Accounting, Australia; email: timothy.wang@sydney.edu.au",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

In both countries their former colonial powers, Britain and France, still influence accounting through economic means (through monetary systems), international financial institutions, political advisors, Northern accounting associations and neo-patrimonialism. However, their use of these differs. While France structures her control mostly around the monetary system established during colonialism, Britain relies on its post-colonial infrastructure and accounting profession, and concedes much influence to the USA, essentially through international financial institutions. France exerts more direct control through advisors than Britain (with the USA). The French approach is conceptualized as coercive-neo-colonialism and the British as soft-neo-colonialism.

We highlight how specific accountability regimes are influenced by the prevailing political, social and economic context within which they operate. We suggest this has caused Muslim NGOs to become ‘exposed’ organisations where demands for accountability, framed by security and counter-terror concerns, are limiting their ability to be accountable. Utilising insight from Kearns (1994) we explain how Muslim NGOs respond to these problems. We find engagement with discretionary accountability tactics allow the NGOs to gain trust of stakeholders, whilst strategic change processes help the NGOs to anticipate and negotiate heightened accountability demands.

For senior as well as early career researchers, a ‘vibrant’ and ‘enabling’ research culture is commonly argued to foster a range of research outcomes by capitalizing upon the benefits that such an environment offers. However, not only has the importance of research culture seemingly assumed the status of conventional wisdom in academic accounting discourse, but the very term ‘research culture’ carries with it an implicit expectation of an ‘ideal’ way in which research outcomes within university accounting schools can be facilitated. What exactly is ‘research culture’, and in what ways does it contribute to research outcomes? This exploratory study seeks to unpack these questions based on interviews with 44 senior accounting academics, drawn from 37 universities across 11 counties. Far from an ‘ideal’, homogenized, one-size-fits-all research culture towards which accounting schools should aspire, the findings of this study point to a continuum of research culture types depending upon the predilection of researchers to adopt a task or relationship orientation to their research. On this basis, we propose a framework within which accounting research culture may be conceptualized.

Despite this setback, and assisted by the unfolding drama of the global financial crisis, PWYP's capacity to frame arguments, form alliances, evolve tactics and shift the target of its agency in response to institutional dynamics, meant they were ultimately successful in innovating, diffusing and instituting [a form of] mandatory country-by-country reporting in Europe and beyond. Such incremental emancipatory accounting change evidences a shift in the balance of power over accounting's processual development away from IASB and neoliberal hegemonic forces. The findings of this research lend substance to Gallhofer and Haslam's (2007) rescuing critique of constructing an international emancipatory accounting, emerging from globalisation's embedded conflicts, consistent with their (2006) post-Marxist thesis of “continuum thinking orientated through struggle” (p. 910). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Country-by-country reporting (CbCR); Diffusion; Emancipatory; Globalisation; Social movement theory",,,,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

We articulate how an explicit mobilization initially restricted emancipatory accounting to an envisaged role in a Marx-inspired understanding of radically grand or revolutionary transformation. We indicate how this came to delimit the construct notably in a branch of social accounting where it was translated into a harshly monochromatic variant. We then elaborate how influential subsequent interpretations of ‘emancipatory accounting’ have tended to broaden from this narrower position. We come to focus on how the construct has been interpreted in an influential discourse through what we term a post-Marxist new pragmatist perspective—which is critical in remaining committed to radical progress but also reflexively aligned to a pragmatic approach. This reflexive orientation suggests the potentially greater centrality and more general applicability of the emancipatory accounting construct and its value for analysing accounting and praxis generally. We consider the potential increased usage of a critical new pragmatist emancipatory accounting. We thus articulate and promote possibilities for emancipatory accounting(s), pointing to an array of emancipatory projects with their accounting interface. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Critical; Emancipatory accounting; New pragmatism; Praxis",,"Gallhofer, S.; Adam Smith Business School, University Avenue, United Kingdom; email: Sonja.Gallhofer@glasgow.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

When the University of Ferrara, a ‘Free University’, resisted the government's intentions, which would also have meant restricting access to higher education to working class youth, accounting practices became essential in providing justification for the government's actions. In response, the University was forced to use accounting practices as its main form of defence. This resulted in the government having to use different tactics to achieve its final goals. If resistance is met by governments in the implementation of their programmes this may require a shift in the tactics originally employed to achieve the planned outcomes. Greater demands were placed on the funders of the University and changes were made to how the University's performance was represented, interpreted and evaluated by the means of accounting practices. In the power struggle, accounting played different roles in the service of conflicting objectives, ranging from concealing the interested nature of political action, demonstrating the achievement of financial stability and self-sufficiency, providing legitimacy or ensuring the use of resources consistent with the aims of those who exercised power. So persuasive was the action enabled by accounting information that the State was finally able to gain control of the University without making it a ‘Kingdom University’, and hence seeming to preserve the appearance of independence almost until the end of the Fascist regime. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,,"Bigoni, M.; Kent Business School, United Kingdom; email: M.Bigoni@kent.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

However, much research in the social and environmental accounting (SEA) literature suggests that an increased level of reporting has not prompted the anticipated increased levels of accountability. Accountability is limited by what is disclosed, and what is disclosed is limited by the extant accounting system (accounting-based accountability). Most current attempts at improving social and environmental accountability by increasing disclosure reflect, at best, incremental changes to the traditional accounting system, a system that has been explicitly designed to meet the needs of financial capital providers. Alternatively, we propose that accounting systems be designed to address specific requirements of alternative accountability systems (accountability-based accounting), and the accountability system requirements should reflect the salient evaluation criteria of the interested constituencies. We propose critical dialogic accountability as a way to conceptualize accountability systems in a pluralistic society characterized by multiple, and often conflicting, interests. We present a definition of accountability that illustrates its complexity, recognizes the salience of power for operative accountability relationships and can be applied both descriptively and normatively, providing a framework for assisting in the specification of the accountability systems and responsibility networks of various interest groups. We discuss some implications for both researchers and practitioners associated with SEA endeavors, concluding with a call for imagining box-breaking accountings that extend the conventional boundaries of the SEA field. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Accountability; Accountability-based accounting; Accounting-based accountability; Agonistics; Critical dialogic accountability; Governance; Pluralism; Social and environmental accountability; Sustainability",,"Dillard, J.; University of Central FloridaUnited States; email: jdillard@pdx.edu",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Building on Goffman's dramaturgical analysis to examine how surveilled individuals present themselves (i.e., their strategies of visibility) to the surveilling audiences and drawing on the 2008 Société Générale (SocGen) trading scandal, we examine the strategies elaborated by the involved trader to initially conceal his misconduct and achieve a positive image vis-à-vis the multiple surveilling audiences. Our analysis shows how strategies of visibility are developed in such contexts by separating a front that complies with audiences’ expectations from a backstage where elements that are inconsistent with those expectations are concealed. The development of such strategies of visibility also requires the segregation of audiences to avoid inconsistencies between fronts. This study further points to the issue of coordination among multiple intersecting control systems. Finally, it reveals the importance of technical literacy in settings with sophisticated control systems, for both the surveilling party, to exert control, and the surveilled one, to manage their visibility. This paper incidentally outlines that while control is increasingly sophisticated and multiple, there is still space for agency.

I find that the technical dependency of corporate accounting on audit blurs the boundaries between the two fields. I argue that this generates conditions for implicit negotiations, in which both groups (corporate accountants and auditors) engage in institutional work. Two subtypes of institutional work are identified as corporate accountants relinquish some of their traditionally institutionalized activities to the ‘expert’ auditors, to maintain field stability, while auditors encroach on the corporate accounting field, to remove obstacles during the implementation of IFRS. While there is no shortage of research documenting the economic outcomes of the adoption of IFRS, there is hardly any examination of how this technical disruption, has affected practices and relations within the accounting domain.

These initiatives typically envision a three step social accountability process where, for example, the publication of previously-private financial information about the inappropriate wealth accumulation activities of politicians and their business allies (step #1), combined with social media dissemination and discussion of these activities (step #2), can result in an accountability conversation that spills out of the medium and that sometimes results in positive social change (step #3). The current study examines Twitter reactions to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalist's (ICIJ) publication of the Panama Papers. The analysis illustrates that there was a Twitter reaction: furthermore, that there were different styles of response and that certain styles were more likely to elicit an audience reaction, especially if the tweeter was a journalist or organization. While the provided analysis focuses on step #2 within the social accountability process, the results imply that publicly-interested accounting academics qua activists can facilitate social accountability by helping to make previously-private financial information public and by cultivating sympathetic individuals within the traditional media as well as within organizations that are active on social media. © 2019","Accounting interventions; Big data and quantitative methods; Panama papers; Social accountability; Social media",,"Neu, D.; Schulich School of Business, Canada; email: dneu@yorku.ca",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

We find that stakeholders exhibit diverse reactions towards firms’ hypocrisy strategies. While stakeholders put more value on firms’ actions-related information, and such actions disclosures attract both positive and negative reactions, talk and decisions disclosures generate positive reactions and reduce negative perceptions. We also investigate how stakeholder reactions trigger firms’ post-disclosure replies and find that firms engage selectively with stakeholders, avoiding those who have concerns or criticism towards firms’ CSR practices.

The study is informed by insights from Michel Foucault's work on lunatic asylums and psychiatric power. Accounting practices of the Royal Insane Hospital of Turin allowed the State as a major contributor to the funding of the asylum to control and monitor the cost of providing the necessary facilities and care for patients. Accounting allowed the hospital to be managed more efficiently which, most importantly, allowed the hospital to provide the support and facilities which were essential for creating the environment required for new medical practices in the treatment of the mentally unwell at a time when the role of doctors was becoming increasingly important. Accounting is also shown to have played a prominent role in supporting the political and social legitimation of the institution and its claim for public and private support.

One avenue was to consider the alternative aesthetic of Islamic financial institutions (IFIs). IFIs offer profit-loss sharing (PLS) schemes as a distinctive spiritual alternative to conventional investment products. IFIs ontotheology clashes with the epistemology of modern banking and finance. The accounting for PLS creates tensions due to practical complexity that militates against implementation of the authentic Islamic financial contracts. This paper seeks to identify the role of accounting in IFIs’ practice of interpretation to resolve the struggles that have taken place around the implementation of PLS schemes as a means of spiritual based financial alternatives. We explore how IFIs use accounting in rendering notions of spiritual/prophetic values applicable to practice or how it colludes against their implementation. Our study adopts a qualitative research methodology, framed around 40 interviews and observations of PLS implementation in IFIs in five Muslim countries in Asia and the Middle East, and one in the United Kingdom. We combine the literature on accounting and religion with the ideas/concepts from the literature on religion in organizations, political economy and Islamic law/finance. These perspectives enable us to better reveal how accounting works to reinvent spirituality. In our context we show how accounting mediates the conflicting interests and intentions that arise within the epistemological clashes that happen as the scared/religious strives to take its place in the capitalistic context of the conventional finance industry. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Accounting in tensions; Profit-loss sharing; Pseudo spirituality; Religious/spiritual ideals",,"Hidayah, N.N.; Aston Business School, Aston Triangle, United Kingdom; email: n.hidayah1@aston.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Our results reveal that, using a cluster analysis, Mafia-controlled firms can be classified into two different groups corresponding to real firms and shell firms, based on specific assumptions on their distinctive peculiarities. Importantly, our regression estimations provide evidence of different TRM practices of these firms, which may be linked to specific money laundering activities. Finally, the seizure of Mafia-controlled firms and their assignment to legal administrators only have a significant impact on TRM within Mafia-controlled shell firms, whereas the null impact on TRM, within Mafia-controlled real firms, casts doubt on the ability of legal administrators to completely deter money laundering. This study proposes new TRM proxies, based on the nature of the expenditure transaction, which could be used by authorities as accounting red flags of money laundering activities. Furthermore, this study may support critical arguments against the orthodox view of the anti-money laundering role of accounting and the suitability of traditional TRM proxies to depict practices within firms sharing common traits with Mafia-controlled firms. Indeed, these firms may engage in TRM for illicit and/or opportunistic purposes, when the external scrutiny is weak, their financial statements are irrelevant for trading with stakeholders, because of competitive advantages or dominant market positions, and they can count on colluded actors as counterparties of money laundering transactions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Mafia-controlled firms; Money laundering; Shell firms; Transaction management",,"Ravenda, D.; Toulouse Business School, Campus Barcelona, C/ Trafalgar, 10, Spain; email: d.ravenda@tbs-education.es",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Specific signifiers were articulated and re-articulated into different chains of equivalence to create an appeal for each discourse surrounding the steel mill's valuation. The anti-privatization discourse's ‘success’ derived from its ‘interdiscursivity’ i.e. drawing on disparate signifiers from different meta-discourses; accounting, nationalism, state corruption and ‘informal’ signifiers such as ‘family silver’, ‘market value’ and ‘throw away price’. In contrast, the pro-privatization discourse drew on a homogenous (financial)economics discourse using more formal and technical signifiers such as ‘going concern’ and ‘sensitivity adjusted discounted cash flow value’. The anti-privatization discourse, with its diverse and informal (accounting)signifiers gained ‘empirical validity’, ‘narrative fidelity’, ‘and experiential commensurability’, appealed more to the masses, the media, and the judiciary. It convinced them selling PSM was a grave injustice, which must be prevented. Hence the Supreme Court reversed the privatization decision, which soured executive-judiciary relations, and led the military government to suspend the Chief Justice of Pakistan, and later the judiciary, media outlets, and the Constitution, which precipitated a successful social movement for an independent judiciary and the restoration of democracy. Events were shaped by the various interests of parties concerned and created new identities for them. The paper concludes by reflecting on how the findings contribute to, and add new issues for accounting research using discourse analysis. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Critical accounting and law; Discourse theory; Pakistan; Privatization; Public sector; Valuation",,"Ashraf, M.J.; Lahore University of Management SciencesPakistan; email: jashraf@lums.edu.pk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

It focuses on a national post-crisis financial market reform, namely the French structural banking reform of 2013, which is characterized by a remarkable discrepancy between the ambitious announcements that accompanied the reform and its actual impact on banks’ structure. By analysing the justifications put forward by policy-makers in support of their decisions on the amendments to the bill, this paper investigates how policy-makers succeeded in maintaining and defending the historically dominant logic (i.e., market)in a situation of controversy by actively mobilizing different orders of worth. Complex mechanisms of reconciliation between orders of worth are revealed. In particular, the study identifies the strategy of symbolization of the competing order as a means of supporting the dominating logic in the context of a national post-crisis financial market reform. The technique of balancing different measures with diverging impacts on the banking sector enables the policy-makers to refer to a (symbolic)equilibrium solution, which shields their actions against criticism and helps them to achieve legitimacy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Banking regulation; Institutional logics; Justification; Orders of worth",,,,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Drawing on Gramsci's work on hegemony and interviews with local practitioners in Greece, we explore the role of Gramscian “common sense” in bolstering consent about the superiority of IFRS over local standards. We find that local practitioner understandings of the operation of the standards are fragmented and contradictory; notions of the common sense behind the high quality of IFRS are in conflict with the reality of collective practical experience—or “good sense” in Gramsci's terms—where the standards fail at specific levels to provide conclusive benefits. However, local practitioners appear to organise their overall consensus on the appropriateness of IFRS, drawing on justifications closely linked to espoused and hegemonic aspects of the common sense of neoliberalism, including the tropes of Europeanisation and modernisation. Therefore, despite the contradictions identified in the operation of IFRS and the inability of the standards to fulfil their objectives, the conflict between common-sense and good-sense understandings has led—at least temporarily—to the wide endorsement of IFRS by practitioners. The evidence challenges economic justifications of the functional utility of IFRS at the level of reported practical experience. That viewpoints about IFRS are found to be so contradictory and fragmented also challenges conceptions in existing literature about the coherence of the IFRS project. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Hegemony; IFRS; Neoliberalism; Users",,"Mantzari, E.; Department of Accounting, United Kingdom; email: E.Mantzari@bham.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Drawing on postcolonial theory, it analyses the visual images that these organisations use to understand critically how they represent and construct identities about themselves and their divergent constituents, namely the Southern constituents they work with, and the funders and volunteers who support their activities. The analysis suggests that on the one hand, in accordance with the accountability remit of annual reports, organisations deploy visual imagery to complement their stories of successes and achievements. On the other, however, these representations also formulate identities about the organisations themselves and their divergent constituents. Organisations frequently (but possibly unintentionally) present their Southern constituents as reliant, dependent, passive, backward, voiceless, unintelligent and needing care in accordance with the traditional charity model of development. There are also signs that they segregate Africa from the rest of the world. In accordance with postcolonial theory, these representations enable organisations to construct themselves as reliable, able and knowledgeable experts who better the lives of Southern constituents. Northern NGOs also represent and appreciate their donors and supporters as active, energetic, willing and generous ‘do-gooders’ in the development project. The varied and diverse representations not only question the seemingly neutral and objective role of the annual report, but also compromise the principles of dignity, respect, equity, solidarity and egalitarianism that are immanent to development NGOs. © 2018","Annual reports; Identity constructions; Non-governmental organisations; Post-colonial theory; Visual images",,,,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The study introduces debates from Muslim Feminism on resistance through egalitarian and ethics-based re-interpretations of religious texts. It parallels these with ordinary professional Muslim women accountants’ strategies. The article finds that SWAs significantly mobilise religion-based strategies to contest patriarchal interpretations of their roles in Islam, and to secure access and progress in the profession. These strategies go beyond shifting between defensive/compliance and offensive/challenging approaches to incorporate a third authentic/ethical dimension often neglected in professional and organization research on women's resistance strategies.

A review of critical accounting work on rail privatisation in Britain is conducted, and a comparison is made with other instances of accounting academics working with social movements. Past work emphasises a Bourdieusian pre-occupation with intellectual autonomy from social movements. An alternative – a Gramscian understanding of the potential for ‘organic intellectuals’ to develop subaltern consciousness – is instead proposed. This frames a discussion on the similarities and differences between critical academic accounting work with rail social movements, compared to past efforts. The central questions addressed are: What ‘value’ do accounting scholars bring to social movements, and how might we judge and learn from the ‘successes’ of our activities? Is it preferable for critical academics to maintain ‘autonomy’ from the class struggle while striving to assist subaltern social movements? Does the neoliberalisation of higher education preclude social movement-orientated praxis? And, if not, how might the constraints that it poses on our activities be overcome? It is argued that a class-orientated, political praxis is both possible and desirable in the current conjecture, but more examples and studies are needed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Accounting academics; Class; Gramsci; Neoliberalism; Privatization; Rail; Social movements; Strategy; Trade unions",,,,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Pensions are therefore directly implicated in the well-being of older members of the population and hence are a potential source of significant social and societal risks. This paper critiques the role of accountants and accounting technologies in the treatment of the social and societal risks inherent in the UK occupational pensions’ landscape in relation to four characteristics of pensions’ security, namely that pensions should be predictable, stable, long-lasting and comprehensive. The UK pensions’ landscape has undergone rapid and fundamental change in recent years. A range of examples drawn from state, public and private sector occupational schemes are discussed. Across all sectors, while some people have gained, others have lost valuable pension benefits. In occupational schemes, employer costs have been reduced and pension liabilities have been de-risked, usually involving risk sharing with employees or risk shifting towards employees. The role played by accountants and other business advisers in quantifying, analysing and mitigating this work is critiqued. The rhetoric of de-risking, security and enablement inherent in the various pension changes, where the reality is often different, is examined and implications for social and societal risk explored. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","De-risking; Occupational pension schemes; Risk shifting; Social and societal risk; State pensions",,"Kaifala, G.B.; Accounting and Finance Subject Group, Main Building, United Kingdom; email: Gabriel.Kaifala@glasgow.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The work also investigates the intermediary role of individuals who deal with these institutions. Theoretically, it triangulates institutional logics and labour process theories, linking higher-order institutions with mundane labour practices observed in the case study. Empirical data were solicited in a village community, where sugar beet farming and processing constitutes the main economic activity underlying its livelihood. Data were collected through a triangulation of interviews, collection of documents and observations. The study concludes that, especially in less-developed countries agro-manufacturing settings, community institutions, including family and religious institutions, play a central role not only in implementation of management accounting and control but also in the mobilization of labour resistance. That is management accounting and control can be effectively practiced, and be resisted, through such social systems. This study affirms the influence of individual agency and subjectivity on institutional logics.

We investigate key organisational information in order to discover any potential links between funding sources and disclosure practices. In Italy, today there is an on-going effort to encourage public engagement in civil society. A percentage-tax law allows taxpayers to dedicate ‘cinque per mille’ (one-half percent)of their income to NGOs, which is then deducted from their tax obligation (Hereafter, ‘5 per thousand’). Our primary research objective is to understand if there is a link between the ‘5 per thousand’ donations that NGOs receive for providing social impact, and their reporting practices. Therefore, we critically analyse if and how sustainable reporting practices are achieved within the top 100 most funded NGOs that receive the ‘5 per thousand’ donation. We examine public data from official government records published by the Italian Revenue Agency. The findings suggest that sustainability reporting offers a number of financial and social advantages, including social impact that builds trust towards the idea of civil society and its funders. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","NGO funding; Social impact disclosure; Social impact measurement; Sustainability reporting",,"Gazzola, P.; University of Insubria, via Monte Generoso 71, Italy; email: patrizia.gazzola@uninsubria.it",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Recognizing that serious indications of tight boundary gatekeeping are on the rise in the accounting research domain, we highlight the extent of negative consequences ensuing from this kind of behavior. We also maintain how, collectively speaking, we may gain from developing more receptive attitudes toward the peripheral. Along with several other writers, we view work at the periphery of an area's research boundaries as having significant potential for the development of new ideas and innovations. However, an excessively protective center may prevent these ideas and innovations from being brought into the field of visibility, especially when the center is inclined to issue stringent reviews and this degree of stringency, somehow, reverberates in peripheral journals’ reviewing practices. We believe that the longer-term sustainability of accounting research requires the incremental development of spaces of receptivity toward the unexpected and peripheral. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Accounting research; Boundary gatekeeping; Center and periphery duality; Epistemological viewpoint; Innovation; Research diversity",,"Gendron, Y.; Faculté des sciences de l'administration, Canada; email: yves.gendron@fsa.ulaval.ca",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Since the 2004 Word Development Report, the Bank's leadership has been declaring its commitment to social accountability. This paper excavates what lies behind ringing declarations of commitment to social accountability in the context of Ghana's Public Financial Management Reform Programme. Empirically, it draws on four months’ fieldwork into the accountability practices this programme brought about and an extensive analysis of WB discourses on public sector reforms and social accountability. Theoretically, the paper draws on Foucault's governmentality and the notion of agonistic democracy central to the recent democratic accountability debate in critical accounting circles. The paper argues that WB's social accountability crusade hinges on the neoliberal concerns of efficiency and fiscal discipline rather than creating a democratic social order, which then questions the very notion of social accountability that WB is propagating, especially its discursive and ideological “short-circuiting” of democratic processes. The paper finds that the dominant and dominating accountability forms that facilitate WB's financial hegemony are privileged over potentially emancipatory ones. The findings highlight that as the local governments become responsible to international development agencies through the “social accountabilities” that WB is promoting they become less socially and democratically accountable to their own populace – the very place where social accountability should truly rest. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agonistics; Ghana; Governmentality; Public financial management reforms; Social accountability; World Bank",,"Alawattage, C.; University of AberdeenUnited Kingdom; email: c.g.alawattage@abdn.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Our story begins in the 1940s, a period characterized by seemingly disconnected debates emerging from the USA about how best to manage government operations. We show that over the ensuing six decades, a small but influential epistemic community was able to problematize public sector management and accounting practices and cultivate the perception that the public sector needed to be more ‘business-like’ and that in order to do so, the adoption of ‘better’, in this case ‘accrual’, accounting was crucial. In doing so, we inform existing understanding of the early development of accrual accounting in government – the international dimensions of which are not widely acknowledged. Further, we show that in our setting, an epistemic community with transnational dimensions was crucial in enabling the reforms to occur, by disrupting the status quo in government accounting, and diffusing an accrual solution in several settings globally incubated in a discourse of business terminology that characterized governments as businesses. The epistemic community was able to diminish debate and invoke arguments to support the implementation of accrual accounting based on asserted enhancements to accountability, even though such reforms were largely untested in the public sector. Thus, we supplement existing research, by enhancing our understanding of how epistemic communities can make significant accounting change appear seemingly inevitable when it could have been otherwise. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Epistemic communities; Problematization; Public sector accounting; Reform",,"Newberry, S.; Discipline of Accounting, Australia; email: Susan.Newberry@sydney.edu.au",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Various societal actors, such as governmental and non-governmental organisations, academics and the media, have voiced their dissatisfaction with the negative effects of tax avoidance on state budgets. This is indicative of a changing attitude towards tax avoidance practices, and the public's expectations of tax consultancy activities. Applying an institutional logics framework, this paper interprets the traditional values of tax consultancy as articulating commercial logic, and identifies new societal developments exerting pressure for ethical practices in the tax consultancy profession. While there are visible signs of both logics currently coexisting in Western countries, less is known about how these logics manifest in contexts beyond the Western world. We take an in-depth look at tax consultancy in Romania, a country that continuously strives to balance the remnants of its communist past with its newly claimed European identity.

However, there is a vast body of evidence suggesting that they do not consistently deliver superior Value-for-Money (VfM), a central argument for engaging private industry partners. In response to the call by Andon (2012), we investigate the rationale behind governments’ continuing deployment of P3s, focusing on the factors affecting the nature and performance of P3s. We draw on contemporary institutional theory to explain the Alberta government's deployment of P3s as a legitimate infrastructure delivery mechanism. While the P3 model has been beset by numerous problems, governments persist with P3 deployment. This practice is traced to institutional environmental forces that are set in motion to implement, sustain and institutionalize P3s as a ‘take it or no asset’ policy. Furthermore, we identify motivations tied to a new understanding of macro (group) and micro (private) interests that enact, sustain and institutionalize ‘preferred’ policy measures cloaked as ‘public interest’. Consistent with the current view of P3s as complex hybrid organizations that confront pluralistic circumstances, we argue that there is an absence of a reflective consideration among the invested local actors in balancing the competing stakeholder interests impacted by P3 policy. Furthermore, we outline the implications for the accounting industry as knowledge carriers in guiding the situated jurisdictional evolution of P3s, especially in recognition of the dual nature of P3s that are presented as objective decision models, but are context-driven and socially constructed as part of P3 policy adoption and implementation. Consequently, given the shifting political dynamics regarding the efficacy – and sustainability – of P3s, whether the end could be near for Alberta's P3 experiment or a temporary hiatus is an open question that this paper will attempt to address. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Critical accounting; Institutional theory; Interpretive accounting; P3; Public-private partnerships; Traditional infrastructure procurement; Value-for-money",,"Opara, M.; College of Business, 2600 South Neal Street, United States; email: Michael.opara@tamuc.edu",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

As prior accounting scholars have shown, Frankfurt School critical theory aims to mobilize rationally-defensible norms embedded in, or ‘immanent’ to, extant social practice that can effect emancipatory social change. While prior critical theory focuses on Jürgen Habermas, Honneth offers a promising alternative. Habermasian critical accounting derives critical norms from rational pre-conditions of autonomous social discourse. Honneth mobilises a broader set of norms from two alternative sources: (i) a philosophical anthropology of recognitive self-development; and, (ii) sociological reconstructions of normative pre-conditions of specific institutions or social practices. Honneth's critical theory can illuminate injustices and pathologies in which accounting is complicit, but which fall outside of Habermas’ discursive-procedural lens. The paper illustrates these possibilities across multiple levels of critical accounting research. Within organisations, Honneth's philosophical anthropology of recognition can provide a richer phenomenology of how accounting practices or systems can impair subjects’ self-relations. Honneth's normative sociology also suggests some less historically contingent, more rationally-grounded strategies to critique accounting institutions and frameworks that violate their own enabling promises or norms. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Critical theory; Habermas; Honneth; Integrated Reporting; Recognition; Resistance",,,,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

As crime is socially constructed we concentrate on two intertwined terrains of struggle: first, the privatization of prisons and second, the “creation of the other”. Controversies over privatization are pervasive and we illustrate that a raison d’être of privatization – minimizing costs – is discredited and distorted. The devastating consequences of privatization further the divide in communities between those privileged and those vulnerable based on race and class. Through this neoliberal process of privatization and racialization of crime there is a creation of the other – a powerful and hostile discourse. We are troubled that a crime-control dynamic mythologizing and fearing the other has become so institutionalized that domination and injustices are normalized. Accounting contributes to these processes with techniques claiming objectivity, but with undeniable moral impacts. Illustrating these dynamics, we review policies surrounding a four-decade “war on drugs” in the US, appraised as an assault on marginalized (poor) populations. Contrasting to white collar-financial crimes we make visible how incarceration displaces certain groups from significant entitlements of citizenship. While statistics indisputably reveal prejudicial treatment, this is only part of the story. Numbers reduce phenomena to simplistic representations erasing humane meaning and obscuring social dimensions of discrimination and power permeating incarceration practice. Acknowledging these complexities, one aim is developing counter accounts to promote new visibilities to advance social justice. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Discrimination; Incarceration; Neoliberalism; Privatization",,"Lehman, C.R.; Hofstra University, 134 Weller Hall, Department of Accounting, Taxation and Legal Studies in Business, United States; email: Cheryl.R.Lehman@Hofstra.edu",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Theoretically, the paper draws on Adler and Borys’ concept of enabling and coercive formalisation as well as Foucault's work on disciplinary power and neo-liberal governmentality. Empirically, the paper explores how accountability was enacted in budget conferences held by local authorities with disabled persons who received personal budgets from the German state. The case study sketches the enabling and coercive practices of personal communication, assistance, transparency, and flexibility that were enacted to hold disabled people accountable for their personal budgets. To management accounting research, this paper contributes an in-depth case study on how disabled persons can be enabled by accountability processes. The paper suggests that accountability can be enabling if the distinct, and individually unique abilities of accountable subjects are recognized. It argues that the personalized combination of enabling and coercive accountability practices constitutes accountable subjects in vivo and can alter their (dis)abilities.

Drawing on a comprehensive set of empirical materials, this paper provides a rich account of how accountants made sense of their professional identities in the context of the unification of three Canadian accounting associations. In a sharp contrast to what prior studies have examined in terms of knowledge, personal trait, and presentationalism, this paper reveals that professional identity is often construed by accountants in terms of self-privileged standing in perceived social pecking orders (identity ranking) and in terms of professional life journey (identity experiencing). Self-privileged standing is about how one is positioned and compared with others; professional life journey, on the other hand, entails not just the past but also the future and is laden with cognition, meanings, and emotions. These two aspects of professional identity are co-constitutive and feed each other for accountants’ identity work, in which the sense of professional security (or insecurity) plays an important role. This paper in its totality highlights the dynamic, fluid nature of professional identity. But more importantly, this paper points to the problematic hollowing out of the very meaning of the term “professional” in the accounting field. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Identity experiencing; Identity ranking; Life journey; Professional identity; Professional insecurity; Self-privileged standing; Social pecking order",,,,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The budget is theorized as visual and theatrical. Analysis of video recordings of budget meetings and on-scene observation of budget-making at a site of city management reveal visual triggers, rhetoric, and framing that constitute budgeting as visual discourse. A central impression presented in this paper is that of uncontrollability. The apparatus of budgeting is complex and grows in an undisturbed way, given that budget actors seem to be passive in taking leadership roles to substantively promote change. This paper draws attention to numerous elements of budget-making that highlight visual accounting as part of its apparatus. This view is in contrast to classic theories of controllability that claim Weberian bureaucratic ideals of rationality, efficiency, and professionalism. Two scholarly contributions are claimed. First, this paper joins a growing academic conversation about visual accounting, and extends this discussion with an exemplar of management accounting. Until recently, the visual has been inappropriately neglected in accounting research, particularly in studies of the public sector. Second, this paper applies Goffman's dramaturgy, an underused perspective in the accounting literature and a thought-provoking methodology with a capacity for what may be regarded as “visual critique”. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Accounting discourse; Budget; Dramaturgy; Municipal administration; Visual accounting",,,,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

It explores the genesis and dynamics of its antithesis; a self-conscious choice by managers to focus exclusively on fulfilling, or being seen to fulfil, the demands of external transparency. Whilst ‘decoupling’ was originally conceived as a way for organisations to meet external pressures without compromising operational efficiency, the paper suggests that managing only with transparency serves to produce a less happy and more consequential decoupling whose contradictions are focused in management/staff relations. The paper builds on recent discussions of ‘tight coupling’ ‘functional stupidity’ and the importance of ‘spectacle’ in contemporary organisations to explore the dynamics of managing only with transparency; an exclusive focus on managing only what is transparent. It suggests that this can prove functional for managers as a way to deny any dependence on local knowledge, and avoid engagement with the complexity of operational interdependencies. However, it leaves staff to manage for themselves the demands of operational integration; a task made more difficult by the contradictions and conflicts created by the intrusion of managerial demands to meet ill-informed and thereby ill-conceived targets and objectives. In this way ignorance is knowingly and actively cultivated by management, whilst intelligence and reflection are self-censored out of organisational processes by subordinates. The analysis serves to further illustrate the power of transparency to play upon and mobilise a narcissistic preoccupation with either the defence or advancement of the self. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Accountability; Management control; Means–end decoupling; Transparency",,,,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Importantly, the studies that I review demonstrate that corporate governance settings constitute privileged sites to investigate power and marginalization processes. Focused on the backstage of corporate governance, these studies bring to the fore two key processes through which power and marginalization operate at the board level. The first relates to the constitution and propagation of myths. The second consists of board members whose reflective skills are kept underdeveloped. From a forward looking perspective, I especially seek to encourage the future development of critical research on corporate governance in ways that break the mold of gap-spotting research.

Drawing on the theoretical framework of Mauss (1925) to analyse accounting practice as revealed in Thai company annual reports, this paper elaborates a Buddhist relational theory of accounting practice that focuses on the importance of patterns of practice generated by gifting, exchange and reciprocity. It studies the ways that accounting as evidenced in the relational practices of Thai annual reports creates patterns of corporate, societal and state identity in late 20th and early 21st-century Thailand. The article also relates this Thai Buddhist conceptualisation of practice to other theoretical approaches, particularly Foucault, Giddens and Latour, which accounting historians have adapted to express the interaction of human and structural agency in practice. In doing so, the paper seeks to highlight some of the limitations in such accounting theorisation and emphasise the importance of a focus on normative patterns of relational practice as an explanation of accounting formation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Accounting; Buddhism; Company reports; Mauss; Patterns of practice; Thailand",,"Kuasirikun, N.; University of Manchester, Booth Street West (Crawford House), United Kingdom; email: nooch.kuasirikun@mbs.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Mobilising the theory of strategic action fields (SAFs), we conceptualise the evolution of such reforms as a protracted framing process where different actors sought to influence the meanings attributed to shareholder-focussed governance practices. We examine how challengers of extant governance practices, such as the World Bank, and incumbent actors representing the interests of the Chinese state vied for influence over governance reforms and how various regulatory bodies, assuming the role of internal governance units (IGUs), enjoyed varying degrees of success in advancing context-specific governance practices. Shareholder-focussed accounting techniques, such as Economic Value Added (EVA™), played an increasingly salient role in this process. Yet, emerging governance practices primarily came to reflect the interests of the Chinese state in maintaining and increasing the value of state assets whilst preserving its political control of SOEs. We contribute to the literature on financialisation by showing how pressures for shareholder value creation can be channelled into governance practices which attenuate the pervasive effects of financialisation in contemporary society. We also contribute to research on accounting in emerging economies by exploring the under-researched role of IGUs in the local adaptation of “Western” governance practices. We discuss how future studies can bring these bodies of research closer together and extend research on financialisation to a wider range of institutional contexts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","China; Financialisation; Governance reforms; Institutionalisation; State-owned enterprises; Strategic action fields",,"Modell, S.; Alliance Manchester Business School, United Kingdom; email: Modell@mbs.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Third, the distinctive approach that ethnomethodology takes to the study of social organization is presented in order to outline what it could offer to the understanding of strategic organization in particular. The paper concludes by discussing the insights that ethnomethodology can offer in the strategic management field, including existing applications and potential future lines of enquiry, particularly in the field known as Strategy-as-Practice. The conclusion advocates a move away from rational analytic models, proclamations and prescriptive treatments of strategy towards studying the more mundane work that enables strategic action to take place, notably the production of accounts of various kinds. It is argued that through accounts, members produce the social facts that generate 'strategies’ of various kinds. This necessitates studying fact production ‘in flight’. Strategic organization is thereby conceptualised as an ongoing achievement of member's ethno- methods for producing it. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ethnomethology; Garfinkel; Strategy",,"Neyland, D.; Goldsmiths, United Kingdom; email: d.neyland@gold.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Second, drawing on Martin (2014) these concepts are applied in order to analyze the West's strategy failure in Afghanistan, focusing in particular on the activities of the British and Americans in Helmand province. American and British strategizing, I argue, was hamstrung by a failure to understand adequately the history, context, people, actions and events in which they were embroiled: that is, there was a failure of sensemaking. This exploration suggests the value of sensemaking theory not just to academics but also to corporate strategists and military commanders. Although the nature of this failure and its implications for the West's strategies are analyzed primarily with reference to Weick, I draw also on the broader sensemaking literature especially that which recognizes the linguistic, and in particular narrative character of sensemaking processes.

This means that SAP theory circles around a void that its proponents seek to fill through an endless search for the objet petit a, the paradoxical object-cause of desire. The paper demonstrates this by showing how the SAP literature conceptualizes the practice of strategy in a circular and self-referential way, i.e. as an effect that respectively posits its own cause. The illusion is that the practice of strategy appears to be present from the very beginning in the SAP literature, when it has been constituted post factum. Ultimately, the paper seeks traverse the fantasy of strategy and reveal the surplus-enjoyment at the heart of SAP theory. The paper concludes by exploring alternative ways of understanding the practice of strategy from the perspective of the transgressive ‘act’ (passage à l'acte). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ideology; Master-signifier; Objet petit a; Strategy-as-practice; Žižek",,,,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

There are constant endeavors in the market to develop formal mathematical methods of valuation and to use them as a base for investment decisions. Using the example of contingent convertible bonds (“cocos”), I argue that our understanding of how financial markets function would remain limited if we were to focus only on those formal endeavors. In the case of cocos, stringent mathematical valuation is impossible due to the contingent nature of this product and many future uncertainties. Based on various empirical materials, I demonstrate that the lack of established valuation tools is complemented and compensated by the purposeful efforts to sell this product. Cocos are categorized as simple bonds in order to be sold; they are associated with brands; their risks are marketed in a particular way. This consumptive regime of valuation allows for determining value and investing where formal mathematical valuation is deferred. Thus, incorporating the insight that marketing constitutes markets, the paper sheds light on how financial markets function, and amends the purely calculative perspective of mainstream finance. Furthermore, the paper relates consumptive finance to major issues in critical finance, such as power and governance, risk ignorance and financial illiteracy. More generally, it argues that active selling efforts represent a severe research gap in critical and social studies of finance and should be more clearly outlined and developed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Contingent convertible bonds; Financial markets; Financial risk communication; Valuation",,,,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Beck wrote under the shadow of the nuclear meltdown of Tchernobyl which made clear that we are exposed to risks we cannot necessarily perceive, but are immediately affected once they are realised. The financial crisis of 2007/8 brought the immense risk which the financial industry represents and the regulation aiming to control these risks, to a broader attention. Central to the banking business is the requirement to deal with risk inherent in any business, to provide instruments to manage the consequences of risk, but also to trade these instruments. Additionally to risk management, as required by legislation or regulations such as the Financial Accounting Standards, the aim of banking regulation is also to manage the inherent added risks resulting from the aggregation of risk, i.e. those risks that are created by the management of financial risk by the act of trading the risk. Given the immense importance of risk and its management it is a necessary task to not just discuss the content of regulation, but also the central terms used in it. To ask what do these terms mean, which connotations must be considered when using them, how do they lead our attention? The intention of this paper is to have a closer look at the term “risk bearing capacity” and its use in the banking regulation of the Basel accords. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Banking regulation; Justification; Responsibility; Risk bearing capacity",,,,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

This article contributes to this reflection by expanding the process of research through a pataphysical parody illustrating the imaginary dimension of financial knowledge and its implications for accounting practices. Although this imaginary aspect of financial knowledge is often forgotten in finance, it is nevertheless very important since, as I will explain, it directly shapes the computerization of financial markets and can eliminate the economic referent of accounting signs. These claims will be discussed through the lens of a visual epistemology based on the science of imaginary solutions (pataphysics) to illustrate this imaginary nature of financial models. Discussion of the paradoxical consequences implied by increasing computerized implementation of an imaginary solution will ensue.

In reflecting on the propositions put forward by Endenich and Trapp (2018), an aspect that I believe is currently implicit in their analysis, and which might usefully advance their agenda if made explicit, is the distinction between methodology (e.g. Positivism or Interpretivism) and method. The risk of adopting categories such as “elite”, or, of counting method is that the nature of what diversity might look like remains only indirectly visible. This presents challenges of communication about what different forms of research aspire to achieve. This is an important element of rendering clearer what is the practical nature of complementarity hoped for in a holistic understanding of accounting. Complementarity and understanding between researchers of different methods but sharing a methodology is challenging. The greater challenge, but also thereby the greater potential complementarity, come from engagement across this methodological divide. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Methodology; Research diversity",,,,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

At the same time, there is an ongoing debate about their usefulness as a performance measure. To understand the actual drivers of this measure in the accounting literature, we empirically investigated which factors affect the citation rates of publications in five “top“ journals of the field using a three-step regression to accommodate different theoretical perspectives on citations. Our results show that citation behavior is influenced by both article and author characteristics, suggesting that not only the universalistic but also the particularistic perspective on science is associated with citation behavior in the accounting field. Contrary to previous studies, we identify several particularistic variables as significant, relating to the visibility and position of researchers in the scientific system and to how they promote their research. In addition, the strong effects of the universalistic variables of subject area and research method point to the possibility that the use of citation counts for evaluating performance might create a bias in favor of certain types of research. Overall, our results should urge caution against the uncritical use of citation counts as an indicator of quality and a performance measure. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Citations; Impact; Particularism; Sociology of scientific knowledge; Universalism",,"Meyer, M.; Hamburg University of Technology, Am Schwarzenberg-Campus 4, Germany; email: Matthias.Meyer@tu-harburg.de",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

From a signaling theory perspective, we consider the scholarly profiles of the editorial team members a powerful signal that the journals send to the academic community concerning the types of research preferred for publication. Accordingly, we first develop a signaling theory framework and introduce it to the sociology of accounting research literature, emphasizing the editorial team composition as a crucial aspect of the communication between senior editors and scholars intending to submit their manuscripts. Second, we compile scholarly profiles of 1564 CAR and TAR senior editors, editors and editorial board members serving within a 25-year time frame based on 10,200 papers (co-)authored by them. We then examine whether the papers published in CAR and TAR reflect the subject areas and research methods represented by the editorial teams. Our findings suggest that the two journals send distinctive signals toward the academic accounting community, particularly with regard to “acceptable” research methods. More precisely, CAR signals greater openness compared to TAR. Moreover, our results indicate that the journal publications reflect the scholarly profiles of the editorial teams with regard to research methods but not subject areas.

We present a case study of two such NPOs providing intellectual disability services in Ireland to address our research questions; how do NPO managers perceive the importance of stakeholders and how does this perception of stakeholder salience influence the design and use of management control systems (MCS)? Our research draws on stakeholder salience theory to capture management's salience perceptions of key relevant stakeholders and we use insights gained through a framing of performance as a complex montage of individual stakeholder objectives. This work seeks to develop stakeholder salience theory, suggesting that complexity in stakeholder salience gives rise to a co-existence, or duality, in stakeholder typologies. Stakeholder salience is found to provide a valuable framework for developing insights into MCS and performance constructs in an NPO context. Findings suggest that awareness of stakeholder salience can assist in understanding performance conflicts and tensions captured in salience asymmetries most notably in relation to power. Findings also suggest that MCS design and use reflect management's perception of stakeholder salience and may work to reinforce the status quo. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Accountability; Management control; Non-profit organisations; Public sector; Stakeholder salience theory",,"Conaty, F.; J.E.

It adopts a processual view which instead of conceptualizing neoliberalism as static and ‘end-state’ views it as a dynamic process of neoliberalization. We draw upon Bourdieu's notions of field, capital and habitus to frame our study. We focus on reform of the regulation of social housing in England during the period 2006–2016. We show that the process of neoliberalization of social housing in England was instigated by the state's intervention to change the structure of the field in terms of norms, power relations and positions of players on the field. These changes brought about simultaneous changes in the habitus of the field as well as the structure and habitus of Housing Associations as sub-fields. We demonstrate how these changes create and reproduce a new system of domination where the tenant is the dominated player. We highlight the role accounting played in these changes in terms of being used as a tool by the regulator to achieve social control and drive change within Housing Associations and by the Housing Associations to evidence conformity with the new norms and adaptation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bourdieu; Critical; Neoliberalization; Social housing",,"Ejiogu, A.; School of Business, United Kingdom; email: are16@leicester.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Recent legislative changes in the United Kingdom mean that auditors risk becoming state law enforcement agents in the private sector. We examine this legislation from the perspective of the changing nature of the relationship between auditors and the state, and the surveillant assemblage within which this is located. Auditors are statutorily obliged to file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) into an online database, ELMER, but without much guidance regarding how suspicion is determined. Criminal rather than civil or regulatory sanctions apply to auditors’ instances of non-compliance. This paper evaluates the surveillance implications of the legislation for auditors through lenses developed in the accounting and sociological literature by Brivot and Gendron, Neu and Heincke, Deleuze and Guattari, and Haggerty and Ericson. It finds that auditors are generating information flows which are subsequently reassembled into discrete and virtual ‘data doubles’ to be captured and utilised by authorised third parties for unknown purposes. The paper proposes that the surveillant assemblage has extended into the space of the auditor-client relationship, but this extension remains inhibited as a result of auditors’ relatively weak level of engagement in providing SARs, thereby pointing to a degree of resistance in professional service firms regarding the deployment of regulation that compromises the foundations of this relationship. © 2017","Auditors; Money laundering; Surveillant assemblage; Suspicious Activity Report",,,,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

It triangulates Dillard et al.'s (2004) institutional theory framework with historical institutionalism in order to trace the institutional layers and political processes that connect micro-organizational changes with ideological transformations within the political state. Data comes from an ‘extended case study’ comprising a three-month fieldwork into an Egyptian electricity company's cost management practices and an extensive review of secondary materials on Egypt's electricity-sector reforms. Empirical findings provide insights into the ways in which accounting plays a political role in institutionalizing structural reforms and how that role evolves with the political ideologies of the state. Accounting's political role during the colonial regime was speculation of commercial and scientific gains, while it was signification of centralized political power during the postcolonial military regime. Accounting's role during the neoliberal regime was paradoxical – simultaneously a reformation technology and a deficient institutional apparatus that hindered privatization. Accounting takes political meanings when it institutionalizes the state's reformative ideologies.

This paper studies actions taken by the administrators and managers of Britain's government military manufacturing establishments (GMMEs), from the 1850s onwards, to create a more governable workforce. This objective was achieved through the imposition of disciplinary practices, most importantly the use of time records to ensure attendance at the workplace and expert knowledge-based piece rates to monitor and control labour intensity. The absence of scientifically-established labour standards at GMMEs is acknowledged but, in other important respects, accounting is shown to have played a key role in the formulation of disciplinary practices designed to construct a governable labour force some decades before standard costing became the mechanism for rendering visible efficiency within the workplace. © 2017","Accounting; Foucault; Governable worker; Piece rates",,,,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The strangeness of my career journey is due to the coincidence of my birth: I was born into and grew up in a United States when the New Deal consensus was the prevailing framer of social, political and economic debates, but entered my Ph.D. studies in accounting at the moment that New Deal consensus was being quite forcibly replaced by one shaped by anti – New Deal intellectuals. The resulting Neoliberal revolution has profoundly reshaped American society and is proceeding to reshape others globally. The effect of neoliberalism in Western democracies has been the reshaping of political decision making via colonizing every aspect of economic, social and political life with the framing of market logic. Neoliberalism also profoundly changed the academic discipline of accounting from the one I believed I was entering (the wrong bus I got onto) into one that made me an outsider for my entire academic career. My work has been focused on various aspects of the bad consequences for accounting of that radical change. One of those consequences has been to remove imagination and intellectual playfulness (what little there was) to replace it with a stultifying, dogmatic, methodologically driven system designed mainly to produce politically correct academic reputations. Another consequence has been the stripping of what is essentially a moral discourse (it's accountability, stupid) of any ethical content in order to create an economically technical discourse (e.g., predicting cash flows) without any proven technical capabilities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Accountability; Critical; Sociology of science; US academy",,,,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

This paper develops a typology for examining the rhetorical strategies companies use to persuade audiences of the need to explain rather than comply. Employing a meaning-oriented content analysis approach, the typology is applied to analyse explanations for noncompliance with the UK's Corporate Governance Code. The sample comprises non-compliance explanations of UK FTSE 100 companies over two periods (2004/05 and 2011/12). These periods were chosen as they follow substantial changes made in the UK's 2003 Code and 2010 Code. There were 63 (43) (2004/05 with 2011/12 in brackets) companies not complying with one or more provisions of the Code and 146 (71) explanations for non-compliance. Key rhetorical strategies identified in non-compliance explanations include ‘minimization of negative feelings’ (the damage is not too serious), the use of ‘weasel words’ which disguise non-compliance and ‘transcendence’ (ends justify means). The research shows there is increased use of rhetorical strategies in non-compliance explanations in 2011/12 compared with 2004/05, and the strategies found seem more orientated towards misleading explanations than meaningful convincing rationales. The use of such strategies may lead to mistrust by the market or may damage the ‘comply-or-explain’ system itself. Valid explanations are critical to the working of the ‘comply-or-explain’ system. Understanding the use of rhetoric can be helpful in assessing those explanations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Comply-or-explain; Corporate governance Code; Explanation; Non-compliance; Rhetoric; Typology",,"Shrives, P.J.; Newcastle Business School, United Kingdom; email: Philip.Shrives@northumbria.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

This experiment, which not merely transferred a state-owned and fully integrated industry into the private sector, but dismantled it into over 100 separate entities, has generated considerable and highly critical academic literature. A major contention of this literature is that, contrary to the predictions of its proponents, privatisation has largely failed to improve efficiency and has actually increased costs, or more exactly, costs are higher than they would have been, had privatisation not taken place. However, although various writers have put forward diverse arguments to support this position, robust data on the overall costs of the (now highly fragmented) industry have been lacking. Further, a proper assessment of the additional costs (or otherwise) of privatisation can only be made in light of ‘counterfactual’ estimates (necessarily speculative) of the costs of the state-run industry if privatisation had not occurred. This paper aims to fill this literature gap by: (1) constructing a robust series of the overall operating costs of British passenger rail services since privatisation, (2) projecting, using reasonable assumptions, what operating costs would have been if privatisation not taken place, and (3) estimating the increase in such costs arising since privatisation. The results, whilst they can only be broadly indicative, are nevertheless clear. Even after conservative assumptions, rail privatisation has resulted in considerable additional costs: it was a major public policy error. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","British; Costs; Critical public interest; Privatisation; Railways",,"Stittle, J.; Essex Business School, Wivenhoe Park, Colchester, United Kingdom; email: jstittle@essex.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

However, high profile corporate collapses in recent years have fostered a recognition that internal control encompasses an organisation's broader cultural milieu. The paper argues that internal control may be ineffective − regardless of the technical routines in place − when an apparent acceptance of managerial discourse and managerial intentions is undermined by accommodation. The focus is on the hotel industry in China where junior staff is recruited from the ranks of internal migrants seeking work in the cities. Unprotected by unions or labour laws, such staff creatively cope with their situation by accommodation rather than overt resistance. Internal control systems in Chinese organisations outwardly reflect traditions of obedience, but various forms of accommodation serve to weaken the surface illusion of docility.

We illustrate the role of accounting in achieving limitations to working hours and child labour, drawing on accounting evidence used to resist and support factory reform during the industrial revolution. We compare the evidence on costs and profits presented by both sides in parliamentary hearings and also with data revealed from the business accounts of the main protagonists. These comparisons show that assumptions about cost behaviour were used to exaggerate or mitigate the apparent effects of reduced working time on profits.

We especially interview preparers who influence the production of corporate reports such as the Integrated Report. Preparers are often suspicious of the motives of the IIRC professionals and express concerns about the performance and appearance of the Integrated Report. They tend to believe that the composition of the IIRC Board impairs the credibility of the Integrated Report and negatively influences their trust of this initiative. Furthermore, preparers are concerned about the credibility of a single report and seem uncertain of the benefits or the beneficiaries of IR. Finally, preparers report problems stemming from a lack of adequate and clear guidance, high preparation costs, the format, and the length of the report. They believe these undermine the IR's credibility. Our study thus contributes to the ongoing debate on the importance of trust in the marketing of new professional initiatives. It reveals that the reshaping of the IR's principles was a result of the IIRC's endeavour to expand its accounting expertise territory within a fragile nexus of trust relationships. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Integrated reporting; Preparers; Scepticism; Trust",,"Chaidali, P.P.; School of Economics, 15-19 Tyndalls Park Road15-19 Tyndalls Park Road, United Kingdom; email: p.chaidali@bristol.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

We examine a social activist organisation's challenge to a major corporation to acknowledge the issue of problem gambling and change its poker machine operations. While the professionally sanctioned corporate financial statements and corporate responsibility reports failed to contribute relevant information for an informed public debate, the activist organisation sponsored and produced both narrative and calculative counter-accounts which contributed to public debate. We initially anchor our approach in Habermas to explore dialogic accounts and democratic accountability at the deliberative-agonistic divide. Our contextualised, theorised narrative identifies the accounts and counter-accounts provided by the protagonists. Practically, the paper demonstrates the power of counter-accounts to reinvigorate debate in the public sphere, irrespective of whether it stimulates a change in corporate behaviour. We therefore contend that social accounting should be empirically examined and contextually interpreted. The case brings into focus the deliberative-agonistic divide inherent in democratic systems and recognised in the social accounting literature, and suggests that ideological differences make it difficult for corporate and activist protagonists to co-exist as friendly enemies. This challenges Habermas conception of a public sphere as naively idealistic, since it neglects contemporary ideological, political and power differentials, but proposes a space in which debate about accounting's role in social issues can be agonistically debated. It leads us to call for more theoretically informed, contextualised case studies to examine the potential of accounting to enable public debate on social issues. © 2017","Counter-accounts; Democracy; Gambling; Public sphere; Social accounting",,"Moerman, L.; School of Accounting, Australia; email: leem@uow.edu.au",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Drawing on multiple case studies, we outline the key strategies adopted by Finnish mining companies as they seek to lower their tax burden. After screening the accounts of the companies mining metallic ores in Finland, we provide an in-depth analysis of the tax avoidance arrangements at three of these mines. The mines were operated by two Canadian enterprises that utilized seven different tax avoidance arrangements. The multiple case study approach adopted in this paper is helpful in developing both quantitative and qualitative tax avoidance research, since our findings highlight major deficiencies of datasets commonly used in the dominant quantitative tax avoidance research. Our qualitative approach helps tackle some of the limitations imposed on tax researchers as a result of the considerable secrecy surrounding tax matters. In particular, we argue that the existing tax avoidance research has focused too much on statutory corporate income tax rates even though today, tax minimization relies mostly on specific tax incentives and other loopholes in tax laws. We argue that the arrangements we describe mirror a wider phenomenon where multinational enterprises exert societal power commonly associated with sovereign states. Crossing the disciplinary boundaries of accounting, political economy and tax law, we also contribute to the emerging research agenda on global wealth chains. We call for more attention to the intersections between accounting and tax law for understanding how enterprises can separate their value chains from the intra-firm flows of wealth. © 2017 The Authors","Global wealth chains; Mining industry; Multinational companies; Tax avoidance",,"Ylönen, M.; University of Helsinki, Hiihtäjäntie 8C 23, Finland; email: matti.v.ylonen@gmail.com",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

During periods of national trauma, such as total war, the extent of the profession's pursuit of altruism is thrown into sharp relief. Drawing on role theory, the study examines the emergence and resolution of conflicting expectations of public accountants in Britain during the First World War. While it was initially assumed that the national interest was best accomplished by the enlistment of men from accounting practices for military service, practitioners complained that the resulting depletion of labour adversely impacted on the operation of their firms. This role conflict for leaders of the profession was successfully resolved by the construction of an expansive redefinition of accountants’ contribution to the national interest. The expertise of accountants in taxation and audit was deemed essential to the successful prosecution of the war. A role transition was achieved. Initially identified as contributors of physical manpower on the field of battle, professional accountants became suppliers of essential ‘brainpower’, exercised within the office space. In this way, the self-interest of practising accountants was reconciled to the nation's object of winning the war. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Accountants; Altruism; National interest; Role conflict",,,,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Using a social constructionist perspective, we conduct an interpretative close reading analysis of the speech of BP's [then] CEO, Tony Hayward, at the Annual General Meeting of BP on April 15, 2010. We also analyse the transcripts of 18 other speeches Hayward delivered before the Deepwater Horizon explosion. We find that the language used contributed rhetorically to an ideology of economic efficiency and cost control, in a manner that was inconsistent with an enduring safety culture. We highlight important insights that close reading analysis of the narrative in CEO speeches can provide to help understand a corporation's ambient safety culture. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Annual general meeting; BP; CEO speeches; Safety culture",,"Amernic, J.; Joseph L.

The nation has a large Muslim population that has often been characterised as marginalised, and so the study employs a critical lens to explore views regarding the extent to which the Islamic banking sector meets community needs. The paper investigates and compares the views of everyday Muslims, bank employees and Islamic scholars, finding widespread discontent with the current state of Islamic banking in the UK. Particular concerns were evident regarding the employment of the same (small) group of Shariah experts and scholars' inability (or unwillingness) to provide advice that is properly contextualised for contemporary Western societies. Whilst bankers' views differed from those of both scholars and everyday Muslims in some key respects, the study suggests a strong need for industrial and religious leaders to work together − including the need for deepened Ijtihad (independent reasoning) − to ensure that the sector develops services and products that are of real value to British Muslims. The evidence is shown to be consistent with the postmodern thinking underpinning Mandaville's notions of “transnational space” and “politics of identity” in Islamic diaspora, as well as Kuran's conceptualisation of “fixity” in the faith's teaching. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Critical; Islamic banking; Postmodernism; Social",,"Burton, B.; School of Business, United Kingdom; email: b.m.burton@dundee.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Qualified opinions provide assurance that the financial statements are fairly presented in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), except for a particular matter (e.g., a non-pervasive material misstatement). Despite having the option to issue qualified opinions, auditors rarely use this option. This is not surprising when one considers that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) considers financial statements filed with anything other than an unqualified opinion to be in violation of securities laws, resulting in possible suspension or delisting of the registrant's securities. A proponent of strong penalties would argue that the SEC's stance toward qualified opinions improves financial reporting quality by encouraging GAAP compliance. In this paper, we argue that the opposite may be true. Relying on the auditor-client negotiation literature and economic game theory, we argue that the severe consequences associated with qualified opinions in the US have caused them to become a non-credible threat in the eyes of audit clients, similar to the outcome of the Rotten Kid Game. As a result, auditors are less able to negotiate GAAP compliance by threatening to qualify the audit opinion, resulting in reduced financial reporting quality. We discuss the implications of such an outcome and provide suggestions regarding alternative methods used in foreign securities markets for responding to financial statements filed with a qualified opinion. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Audit opinions; Auditor's reporting model; Auditor-client negotiations; Qualified audit report",,"Vandervelde, S.D.; Moore School of Business, 1705 College Street, United States; email: vandervelde@moore.sc.edu",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The 2004 reform of the Basel Agreements (Basel II) is usually presented as a typical example of the development of such risk-based regulations. By comparing the discourses accompanying Basel II with an in-depth analysis of its technical provisions for credit risk regulation, our study shows that, if the Basel reform was driven by a neoliberal political agenda, it counter-intuitively resulted in a significant development of intrusive disciplinary processes for banks and their credit-management processes. Drawing on Foucault's analyses of neoliberalism, the paper however suggests that the presence of disciplinary aspects in this risk-based regulation should not necessarily be regarded as a “pathological drift” or as a “subversion” from its initial neoliberal program, but rather as both neoliberalism's other face and its very condition. Methodologically, this study also underlines the value of approaching risk management issues by an in-depth analysis of their technical specifications, since this approach enables us to construct the contrasting image of the changes presented here, and consequently to highlight the strong disciplinary processes embedded in this neoliberal-inspired reform and their structuring effects on management accounting and control processes.

This required ‘imagining’ accounting (and associated commercial) technologies in the former centre and re-instituting them in the periphery (the new centre). An important manifestation of this imagining was the development of formal instruction in accounting in Brazil at the Rio de Janeiro School of Commerce, established in 1810. We contribute to knowledge in three major ways. First, we develop understanding of the ‘Portuguese imagination’ by showing how this was evidenced and applied outside the realm of ‘romantic’ literature, specifically here in propagating accounting and accounting-related technologies.

It seeks to explain how SOCPA secured legislated authority to control standard setting and entry to professional practice before the organization developed technical and financial capacity as a professional body. The state corporatist system of Saudi Arabia provided fertile ground for SOCPA's promoters to invoke the need for an accounting body to advance Saudi Arabia's socio-cultural values. The promoters advocated the role of such a body in setting suitable accounting standards for the Sharia law context of Saudi Arabia, and developing an indigenous system of professional accountancy training. The project made a detour from its initial plan for an autonomous professional association, and instead organized SOCPA as a hybrid entity that blends some characteristics of a state agency and a professional body. Further, the project exhibited hybridity in accommodating incumbent practitioners into SOCPA membership, and in setting accounting standards using a mix of American accounting standards and Saudi Arabia's Sharia law. Through these strategies, SOCPA succeeded in securing the authority to restrict the entry of foreign nationals and candidates affiliated with overseas accountancy bodies into the Saudi market. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Accounting professionalization; Actor-network theory; Hybridity; State corporatism",,"Mihret, D.G.; Deakin UniversityAustralia; email: dmihret@deakin.edu.au",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

However, when ICR was first recognised as a management fashion, the intended change it heralded in stable environments was criticised for having limited impact on the state of practice. Conceiving ICR through a lens predicated on the notion of discursive practice, we argue that ICR can enable substantive change in emergent conditions. We empirically demonstrate this process by following the implementation of ICR in one organisation through interviews, documents and observations over 30 months. The qualitative analysis of the data corpus shows how situated change, subtle but no less significant, can take place in the name of intellectual capital as actors appropriate ICR into their everyday work practices while improvising variations to accommodate different logics of action. The paper opens up a new avenue to examine the specific roles of ICR in relation to the types of change enacted. It thus demonstrates when and how ICR may transcend a mere management fashion and the intended change it sets in motion through altering organisational actors’ ways of thinking and doing within the confines of their organisation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Discursive practice; Emergent/situated change; Intellectual Capital Reporting (ICR); Management fashion; Substantive change",,"Yu, A.; Institute of Management Studies, United Kingdom; email: a.yu@gold.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The analysis employs the notion of uncertainty as it is presently used in established contingency-based management accounting (CBMA) research practice. We argue that particular established constructs and measurement instruments dominate the research practice of that field in a paradigmatic manner. Consequently, the constructs and measurement instruments of uncertainty tend to be continuously reproduced in a similar, taken-for-granted manner that does not question their validity. Furthermore, as some of the findings regarding uncertainty in existing CBMA research are mixed, we suggest an alternate path for conducting contingency-based research in management accounting and illustrate this with a field study from the drug development business. The analysis presents an emic inclusive alternative for conducting CBMA research that could complement the currently prevailing etic dominated research, thus significantly widening the current scope of such research. The suggested alternate path for CBMA research is faithful to the original ideas of the early contingency scholars and argues for the opening up of institutionalised research practices in this field of management accounting research. Currently, the situation in CBMA research exemplifies the problem of an institutionalised paradigm actually hindering fruitful development within the research field. Hence, the paper is essentially a critique of the overly mechanistic employment of established research practices, such as those evident in CBMA research. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Case study; Contingency theory; Emic perspective; Management accounting research; Paradigms; Uncertainty",,"Granlund, M.email: markus.granlund@utu.fi",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

We present a case study of the proposed privatisation of two prisons in New South Wales, Australia, including the subsequent public debate and the finalisation of the policy, which together covers the period 2008–2010. The privatisations were justified by the New South Wales government through the use of accounting technologies and discourses which purported to demonstrate that a model of private delivery would be more cost effective than continued reliance on public ownership. Yet, despite the identical accounting rationales given by the government and the Department of Corrective Services for the privatisation of each prison, the policy outcome was to privatise only one of the prisons. We examine the resistance strategies employed by the various union and community groups opposed to the privatisations and find that they differed markedly for each prison. Quite different discourses of costs were mobilised to counter the proposed neoliberal reforms: one was based in orthodox accounting discourse, and the other in a spatially grounded discourse of costs to the community. We therefore argue that spatial factors played a crucial role in the discussion. This contributes to a potentially rich, but as yet under-examined, area of research on the relationship between geography and accounting, and of accounting's contribution to the distinct spatiality of neoliberalism. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Accounting; Geography; Neoliberalism; Prisons; Privatisation; Public policy",,"Andrew, J.; Discipline of Accounting, Australia; email: Jane.Andrew@Sydney.Edu.Au",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The paper critiques accounting researchers' use of the methods of the natural sciences advocating ‘correspondence to some presumed reality' over and against a more ‘interpretivist' and mature view that truth is a property of language (see, Taylor, 2016). A transformation in accounting involves narrating and reporting corporate impacts on the natural environment while recognizing that corporate language perpetuates the logic of that particular social sphere. Through an evaluative reformulation of accounting the designative, instrumental and neoliberal framework is criticised for ignoring concepts such as beauty, intrinsic value and truth. The paper aligns with the hermeneutic-interpretivist tradition developed by Gadamer and Taylor through expressive language whether in the form of written words, speech or images to convey that nature is more than a standing reserve for consumption. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Accountability; Accounting; Beauty; Expressive; Language",,,,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

This includes articulating how accounting can become more ‘enabling’ in a dynamic micro-organizational context. The latter articulation reflects a critical theoretical appreciation and mobilization of the construct ‘enabling accounting’ that begins to contextualize and reconcile aspects of differing usages of this construct in the literature. In framing organizational processes implicating accounting change, the paper furthers understanding of accounting colonization around categories building upon Laughlin (1991) and related studies, including work seeking to develop Laughlin (notably Tucker, 2013; and the Social Network Theory he promotes). Change pathways implicating colonization are in this respect seen as shaped by structural, relational and social mechanisms. The theoretical framing advanced helps to illuminate aspects of colonization processes that facilitate, as well as hinder or counter, meaningfully enabling dimensions of accounting. This enhances the critical theoretical appreciation of colonization in terms of a more complex evaluation. The theorizing is fleshed out and developed through an action research project conducted at the Research and Development (R&D) site of a multinational corporation in France during the implementation of a performance measurement system (PMS). In theorizing accounting colonization and dynamics of an enabling accounting in an R&D setting, we add to prior appreciations of the relation between creative, innovative, ostensibly intuitive and unstructured processes, and, systems of financial control. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Accounting colonization; Enabling accounting; Performance measurement systems; R&D; Structural/relational/social mechanisms",,"Masquefa, B.; IUT de NICE, 41 Boulevard Napoléon III, France; email: Bertrand.MASQUEFA@unice.fr",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

We argue that accounting formalism reigns supreme in contemporary accounting education, and we contrast this with the fate of legal formalism, which, while remaining the dominant mode of legal education, nonetheless declined considerably in influence during the twentieth century. We suggest that the dominance of formalism has resulted in an undue emphasis on the technical aspects of accounting education and a relative pedagogical neglect of the social, critical and ethical dimensions. Drawing on two largely separate discourses in accounting – that which surrounds the role of stewardship/accountability and that which focusses on accounting education – we argue that stewardship/accountability has the capacity to act as the ideal conduit for integrating formalist and anti-formalist perspectives in accounting theory and thereby provide an appropriate and necessary challenge to the dominance of formalism in accounting education. In addition, we propose that stewardship/accountability, as part of the living law (i.e., the moral or customary tradition) of accounting, has the capacity to provide the conceptual foundations for challenging formalism across the inter-related social, critical and ethical dimensions of accounting theory and education. We suggest that such a challenge would bring about multifarious benefits, not only for all those who participate in and thereby constitute the accounting academy, but also for other stakeholders dissatisfied with the trajectory of the current formalist-dominated mode of accounting education. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Accounting education; Legal formalism and accounting formalism and ethical dimensions of accounting; Stewardship/accountability",,"O'Connell, V.; Gulf University of Science and Technology, P.O.

In fulfilling this responsibility, we are concerned with how accounting, accountants, and accountability regimes can facilitate democracy by serving the needs of pluralistic communities, giving particular attention to the various underserved constituencies. Informed by Flyvbjerg's (2001) notion of phronetic social science research that matters, we reviewed 353 articles published in Critical Perspectives on Accounting from 1990 to 2014 identifying the focal constituency(s), the injustice(s) addressed, the groups or institutions responsible for the injustice as well as the proposals for social and political praxis outlined in the studies. Our review indicates that generally the studies identify a somewhat focused, though salient and appropriate, set of economic, social and/or environmental injustices experienced by various constituencies, and to some extent, the studies consider the context and conditions that perpetuate the inequality and injustices. However, as the field matures, there is a need for more robust development of the social and political implications of critical accounting research and for articulating the ideas and implications as action programs. Further, our review suggests that several relevant constituencies such as non-human animals, children, future generations, developing nations, and gender and sex/uality minorities have received little or no attention in the current literature. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Constituencies; Flyvbjerg; Phronesis; Phronetic critical accounting; Pluralism",,"Dillard, J.; Dixon School of Accounting, United States; email: jdillard@pdx.edu",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

This paper reflects on long-standing disagreements in critical and social accounting over the progressive potential of political pluralism. It examines commonalities and differences across three generations of pluralist thinkers: early twentieth-century political theorists, post-World War 2 and neo-pluralist political scientists, and post-structural pluralists. With respect to social accounting, I argue that as in other disciplinary fields post-war liberal pluralism has often been mistakenly viewed “as the whole of political pluralism” (Schlosberg, 1998, p. 583) and that while early second generation pluralism was rightly criticized for providing ideological support for the status quo, critics exaggerated the conservatism of neo-pluralism. Nonetheless, second generation pluralism provides a limited view of democratic politics. I examine the resurgence of interest in political pluralism among contemporary political theorists, highlighting how agonistic democratic theorists have addressed aspects of political quietism in “old” pluralisms and in some strands of post-structuralism. Providing examples from several politically pressing areas, I argue that theorizing, critique and engagement informed by third generation understandings of social plurality and political struggle offer a promising base for critical accounting interventions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Accounting and democracy; Agonistic democracy; Dialogic accounting; Political pluralism",,,,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The aim was also to encourage community-building around other important issues such as critical accounting interventions and their potential, or ways to bring out more emancipatory perspectives on accounting.

The paper starts from the conventional micro-economic framing of banking as the outcome of insufficiently competitive markets, yet after two decades of policy responses the sector is not only more concentrated but also homogeneous, dominated by financialized organisations focused on sustaining high rates of return on equity. Critical business model analysis is used to reframe the banking sector as one based on mimetic behaviours, including mis-selling of financial products and opaque charging. In doing so, the paper contributes to the public debate on the reform of retail banking by highlighting the potential importance of a wider diversity of business models within the sector as a way of offering customers a different choice and limiting the scope of financialized practices. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Competition; Critical business model; Financialization; Shareholder value; Stakeholder credibility; UK retail banking",,"Froud, J.; Alliance Manchester Business SchoolUnited Kingdom",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Although the majority of this research lacks a clearly articulated emancipatory intent, several commentators have recently singled out critical realism as a promising way forward for critical accounting research. This paper seeks to advance this debate by addressing the questions of how the emancipatory potential of critical realism can be realised and how it may contribute to critical accounting research. In doing so, I draw on recent developments in critical realist thought which attempt to reconcile its ontological foundations with those of other social theorists, such as Giddens, Bourdieu and Foucault. This leads to an ontological synthesis pivoting on the interplay between exogenous structures, which reflect the objective life conditions of individual human beings, and endogenous structures, which condition their subjective capacity for reflexivity. I elaborate on how this interplay gives rise to a highly contingent conception of the possibilities of emancipation and examine the extent to which such a view is evident in critical realist accounting research and cognate bodies of critical accounting scholarship. I also examine the epistemological and methodological implications of adopting such a view and how critical research interventions in accounting, centred on the critical realist notion of explanatory critique, can be matched with the contingent possibilities of emancipation. I argue that such critiques can make a valuable contribution to critical accounting research as they compel researchers to go considerably beyond what is immediately observable and probe into the deeper structural conditions that constrain as well as enable emancipation. This may enable accounting scholars to envisage a broader range of alternative, but previously unrecognised, paths towards emancipation. It also provides a counterweight to empiricist modes of explanation, primarily based on observed regularities in social phenomena, which arguably tend to dominate contemporary policy debates. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Accounting; Critical realism; Emancipation; Explanatory critique; Retrodiction; Retroduction",,"Modell, S.; Alliance Manchester Business School, Crawford House, Booth Street West, United Kingdom; email: Sven.Modell@mbs.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

We find that different development phases give rise to distinctive types of management accounting practice, which often do not live up to expectations owing to local politics and other socio-economic factors. Although the quantity of PSMA research on EEs is growing, there is a need for future research that addresses how management accounting practices in the public sector in EEs are impacted by the interplay between the public management programmes of international donor agencies and the political, economic and cultural contexts of EEs. In order to capture these complex socio-political and socio-cultural contexts, solid theoretical foundations are recommended, relying especially on critical and social theories, as well as on qualitative research such as case studies. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Emerging economies; Literature review; Management accounting; Public sector",,"van Helden, J.; University of GroningenNetherlands; email: g.j.van.helden@rug.nl",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The PB practice in the CUC has failed to achieve its fundamental objective—public participation in a manner of equality, justice, and transparency, or at least best partial success in some areas such as rates collection. We have demonstrated how PB has become a practice of power and domination rather than a means of fostering political emancipation in the CUC. The field-specific organisation of various forms of capital has allowed the chairman of the CUC to become dominant and take control of the whole budgeting process and PB, which is aimed at impeding such political practices, has become dominated by the same political dynamics.

In a bid to improve the economic efficiency of the public sector, Pakistani Government embarked on a reform programme soon after the appointment of a former multinational executive as the Prime Minister of the country. A ‘successful’ private sector manager (CEO of a multinational company) was appointed as the director general of the case firm to bring about the changes typically associated with new public management reforms. Cost savings through rationalization of senior management positions became a top concern of this particular reform. However, the reform led to regressive results i.e., an increase in senior management positions rather than a decrease. The paper attempts to explain the circumstances and reasons leading to these regressive effects based on Sieber's (1981) work and the theoretical model developed in the spirit of the critical realist tradition (Bhaskar, 1979).

The data were collected via an extensive review of official government documents as well as qualitative interviews over a six-month period. The analysis reveals that there is perceived notable change in the social structure and working norms and values among employees following the implementation of performance contracting. This perceived change is however being frustrated by inadequate resources and entrenched attitudes and networks of patronage and corruption, especially at the top levels of government. The study illuminates how regulatory discourse, structural changes and incentive and coercive mechanisms combine in an effort to change social capital at the micro level of government agencies but how these efforts are thwarted by strongly embedded institutions.

Data was collected principally by interviewing participants in central and local government and in a number of NGO's. Analysis was undertaken using grounded theory methods, alongside a theoretical framework. This framework comprised the work of the post-colonial theorist Ekeh (1975, 1992, 1994a, 1994b) and the concepts of legitimacy, loose coupling and isomorphism from institutional theory. Legitimacy and loose coupling were central concerns in all the institutions and played a significant role in understanding their accounting practices. However, there were significant differences between the settings’ responses. These can be partly explained as responses to different isomorphistic pressures. Differences between institutions can be further explained using Ekeh's concepts of the primordial and the civic publics. Gaming and corruption were evident in central government, associated more with the civic public. Accountability and a sense of moral responsibility appeared to be stronger in NGOs, which were more closely associated with the primordial public. In contrast to the central government, which was associated more with the civic public, accounting was extremely problematic resulting in many dysfunctional practices. However gaming and corruption were most evident in local government where participants were subject to a conflict between the two publics’ moralities. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Developing countries; Institutional theory; Two publics",,"Goddard, A.; University of SouthamptonUnited Kingdom; email: arg2@soton.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Our results demonstrate accounting firms appear to devote considerable effort to manage their legitimacy in the eyes of prospective employees and apparently use website communications to depict a work environment largely in accordance with Millennials’ system of values and beliefs. This suggests a bottom-up socialization process is taking place whereby accounting firms adapt the workplace in response to future employees’ expectations.

Key justifications for this have included enhancing accountability, reducing public-sector corruption, promoting market efficiency and attracting international capital. However, this paper presents evidence of the role of accounting in the undervaluation of assets, concealment of possible malpractice, and subversion of the accountability that it should have delivered in the privatisation process. The assumption that accounting will enhance accountability, reduce public-sector corruption and promote market efficiency in privatisation, and ultimately attract investment into a crony capitalist Nigerian state, appears to be an illusion created partly through the apparent legitimacy of accounting. © 2016","Accounting; Cronyism; International financial institutions; Privatisation; State-owned enterprises",,"Bakre, O.M.; School of Business and Management, Mile End, United Kingdom; email: owolabibakre@hotmail.com",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

At the same time a fierce political debate took place over the state of nutritional health of the nation. Left wing activists argued that the working classes were significantly malnourished due to an insufficiency of income. The government responded by arguing that it was the domestic ignorance of the working class housewife that was the problem. This debate raged in public forums from parliament to popular press—the term ‘Hungry England’ becoming a common catchphrase. It enrolled a host of medical experts, public bodies and voluntary organisations. Surveys of poor neighbourhoods were conducted to determine nutritional health. Based on family household budgets, these surveys revealed that working class incomes were insufficient to achieve optimum dietary needs and inferences were drawn regarding the nutritional state of the nation. Ultimately, a host of welfare policies to combat these nutritional deficiencies were initiated and we witness the rise of the British Welfare State. This paper examines the polarised political debates of this period from a governmentality perspective (Miller & Rose, 1990; Rose & Miller, 1992). The framework facilitates an understanding of the way in which diverse actors became enrolled in the two nutritional discourses and the mediating role of experts in the process. It also reveals the influential role of calculative technologies, particularly the budget, within the programmatic of government. Finally, this theoretical approach highlights the governance of the body inherent in these dietary and fitness interventions. The notion of the fit and healthy disciplined body that emerged during this time period reflects the cultural trends to come in terms of contemporary obsessions with diet and body image. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Calories; Diet; Governmentality; Household budget; Nutrition; Physical culture",,"Jeacle, I.; The University of Edinburgh Business School, 29 Buccleuch Place, United Kingdom; email: ingrid.jeacle@ed.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Subsequently, numerous sales of heritage assets by local authorities have occurred. We examine the intrusion of economic value into the realm of cultural assets and investigate two cases: the National Portrait Gallery and Tower Hamlets Council. The observation of economic and cultural value is considered. The National Portrait Gallery largely resisted the pressure to place economic values on its collections of portraiture and continues to increase its extensive collections. The London council in a deprived borough, Tower Hamlets, followed the Code of Practice on local authority accounting regarding recognition and valuation of assets and decided to sell its major heritage asset, a Henry Moore sculpture. We examine how measuring value can affect the observed reality: did the very act of measuring a heritage asset in financial terms change the situation? We develop a frame of analysis based on scientific observation theory applied within the socially constructed world of accounting. Accounting constructed a ‘reality’ (Hines, 1988) that included items of economic value that were primarily held for their cultural properties, but observing (measuring) their economic value may affect the perception of the cultural value of the item. Drawing on quantum physics we borrow from Schrödinger's thought experiment, commonly referred to as ‘Schrödinger's cat’, and from Heisenberg's uncertainty principle to suggest that though not killing the cat, observation of the economic value of an accounting element can lead to a change in the perceived cultural value. Thought experiments from quantum physics can provide new ways of exploring the measurement (observation) of different values. Precision in measuring one attribute can cause the perception of other attributes (values) to change. This is particularly important as accounting moves to reporting on an integrated value approach (International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), 2013). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Accounting measurement; Cultural value; Economic value; Heritage assets; Observation theory; Schrödinger's cat",,"Ellwood, S.; School of Economics Finance and Management, 15-19 Tyndall's Park Road, United Kingdom; email: Sheila.Ellwood@bristol.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The discourse of austerity was portrayed as much more problematic and colonising than the extensive accounting monitoring which was taken for granted. The discourses and practices of austerity were implicated in morally ambiguous and role-conflicted organisational behaviour suggesting sublimated legitimation crisis tendencies but there was no evidence of widespread Habermasian motivation crisis in relation to austerity or accounting monitoring. Some organisational members responded actively to accounting colonisation, and as a reorientation or reversal of colonisation, created transformations of accounting through a range of narrative and visual reporting methods.

Among these processes practices of valuation supported by specific accounting techniques play an important role. We propose that in order to understand the decision-making processes of the state, their effects on the arts and their management, and how the state and the arts become intertwined in arts management, can be studied through focusing on practices of valuation. This also enables researchers to understand the role of accounting in this intertwinement better. Drawing on David Stark's concept of heterarchies, we explore the complex practices of valuation in a qualitative case study of the European Capital of Culture (ECC) 2010, ‘Essen for the Ruhr Area’. We show how the state was constructed through multiple actors who acted on behalf of ‘the state’ by using diverging principles of valuation in their interaction with the ECC project organization and its around 300 projects.

This is as a result of longstanding developments within government's approaches to policy making, most notably those influenced by practices of audit and accounting. This paper will outline these developments with reference to Peter Miller's concept of calculative practices, and will argue two central points: first, that there are practical solutions to the problem of measuring the value of culture that connect central government discourses with the discourses of the cultural sector; and second, the paper will demonstrate how academic work has been central to this area of policy making. As a result of the centrality of accounting academics in cultural policy, for example in providing advice on the appropriate measurement tools and techniques, questions are raised about the role academia might take vis-à-vis public policy. Accounting professionals and academics not only provide technical expertise that informs state calculative practices, but also play a surveillance role through the audit and evaluation of government programmes, and act as interpreters in defining terms of performance measurement, success and failure. The paper therefore concludes by reflecting on recent work by Phillip Schlesinger to preserve academic integrity whilst allowing accounting scholars and academics influence and partnership in policy. © 2015 The Authors","Academia; Bauman; Calculative practices; Cultural policy; Cultural value; Multi-criteria analysis",,"Donovan, C.; Health Economics Research Group, United Kingdom; email: claire.donovan@brunel.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

We present case research conducted in five theatres and municipalities in The Netherlands. Although autonomized, these theatres are still subsidised by the municipalities. Therefore, the municipalities have retained a certain degree of responsibility for the theatres. However, the low measurability of the theatres’ outputs and outcomes complicates the municipalities’ control as based on performance agreements and accounting information. This complication increases the role of trust. This study provides insight into the practices and processes underlying trust building and the supporting and mediating role accounting information plays here. Transparency and regular informal contacts between the theatres and their municipalities in combination with accounting documents, which ‘discipline’ the theatres, appear to be crucial in this respect. Furthermore, different hierarchical levels can be distinguished in the trust relationship. Trust first develops at the lower (operational) levels of an organisation, after which it progresses towards the higher organisational level.

Whilst the tension between the surplus orientation of a free market and the welfare orientation of socialism appear obvious, we know little about how these ideals are reconciled within China. In this paper we explore the role that accounting discourse has played in mediating the relationship between socialism and capitalism and in particular, the role that these discourses have played in the reframing of the free market at an ideological level. Using critical discourse analysis (CDA) we examine the convergence of Chinese Accounting Standards (CAS) with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the uptake of Fair Value Accounting (FVA) as it was presented discursively by the government, the media and leading academics within China. We also explore forms of dissent and resistance. Our analysis points to the ways in which the use of accounting discourse has helped progress the market oriented ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party whilst allowing the coexistence of socialist ideals. Using the Chinese experience as an example, our paper provides further evidence of the important role accounting discourse continues to play in the ongoing neoliberalisation of political economies across the globe. © 2015.","Accounting discourse; China; Chinese accounting standards; Critical discourse analysis; Fair value accounting; IFRS; Neoliberalism",,"Andrew, J.; The University of SydneyAustralia; email: Jane.andrew@sydney.edu.au",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The reform was unusual in that indigenous civil servants had considerable discretion over the choice and development of the system. Thus the local capability in developing government accounting technology suited to the local context and derived from learning by experience was created. The system was widely regarded as effective but it was abandoned for a French system which ultimately proved problematic.

Studies suggest that within the accountancy sector both cases are subsumed beneath a strong 'client service ethic,' deployed to justify long hours and support the status quo.

The empirical evidence presented in this study, points towards a lack of images representing professional accounting women.

These findings illustrate the exercise of gendered based exclusionary practices, which facilitate male (professional) elite dominance and assist in the reinforcing of gendered stereotypes.

Challenging the heteronormativity that pervades accounting studies and organisations, this article contributes to this knowledge void by presenting a new line of research which examines LGBT sexualities. It is argued that queer theory can enable accounting scholars to disrupt heteronormativity, destabilise essentialist notions sexuality as fixed properties of individuals and thus advance the study of sexuality within accounting beyond topics such as sexual harassment. Three research trajectories with example research questions are presented to that end: (1) disrupting heteronormativity; (2) queering accounting organisations; (3) queer allies in accounting contexts.

Thirty-one interviews with accountants from small and medium sized accounting firms in regional New South Wales were conducted. Results suggest 'doing gender' continues to be reinforced and reproduced as women's aspirations are constrained by the day-to-day practices shaping expectations about women in regional small and medium sized accounting firms. The internalization of gender stereotypical beliefs about what women can do intersects with the regional and small to medium size of the accounting firms in the study to entrench a specific type of disadvantage for women.

This study focuses on their response to the diversity agenda. We analyse the image of the new, contemporary diverse accountant that is emerging in social media spaces in the UK, US and Canada. Adopting an institutional logics approach, we examine the interplay between multiple logics, with different loci of responsibility that frame public messages about diversity, equality and inclusivity. A traditional favouring of homogeneity is giving way to heterogeneity as integral to professional success. The value of diversity, and its celebration, is growing visibly. However, the containment of diversity discourses to the language of productivity, as a branding opportunity, a client expectation, a battle for diverse talent, and successful networking raises queries about the extent of any deep change in professional logics. Rather, diversity has been institutionalised through its attachment to traditional, commercial, professional discourses and motifs. These discourses do little to indicate a rupture in the power of firm hegemony. Explicit messages strategically position diversity as an economic good and an aspect of a commercially relevant professional excellence. Implicit messages point to ambiguities and certain conditions that are attached to the new image of the diverse accountant. Public interest logics presenting diversity as a social good, prompting self-reflection by firms about behaviours, are less prominent.

This paper explores how the concrete spaces of urban grids, some of the earliest forms of grids, parallel the spaces of today's accounting grids. The origins of these urban grids afford profound insights into the preference for grids as employed in contemporary accounting. The reasons for grids are here explored in the framework of the structural properties introduced by Giddens: signification, legitimation, and domination. Grids are shown to signify issues with positive connotations that can also be related to accounting, such as efficiency, quantification, and rationality, as well as transcendental ideals about ""correctness"", ""justice"", ""truth"" and ""equality"". These significations legitimate grids and their contents and produce domination of the issues gridded. Domination is also achieved by grids signifying and legitimating control and order. Moreover, the prevalence of grids can be explained by their simplicity and their ability to be easily extended; these characteristics assist in the signification of the contents gridded, thereby again legitimating grids themselves as well as their contents and producing domination of the accounting space. Underlying all these factors is the so-called oblique effect according to which humans have an inherent physical preference to see issues around them in gridiron forms. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Critical; Grids; Management control; Space",,"Chakhovich, T.; University of Turku, Finland; email: terhi.chakhovich@utu.fi",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

From the end of the 1930s, unions began taking a critical interest in accounts to support demands that workers receive a 'fair share' of profits. In 1945, the UAW demanded that General Motors raise wages by 30% without increasing its prices and, if it disagreed, to 'open the books'. Business leaders saw a socialist threat in these demands and the public's hostility towards large corporations. In response, they launched the 'Free Enterprise Campaign', drawing on Irving Fisher's accounting theory to undermine unions' demands that big businesses be socially accountable for the process of earning profit. By the early 1950s, union militancy had disappeared and by the end of the 1950s so had the demand for accountability. This evidence, the paper concludes, is consistent with the hypothesis that the unions' acceptance of Fisher's theory underlay the creation of 'consensus capitalism'. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Accounting; American Unions; Consensus capitalism; Socialism",,"Bryer, R.; Warwick Business School, Scarman Road, United Kingdom; email: rob.bryer@wbs.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

However, in that process its natural environment has been degraded and become more vulnerable in geophysical terms (e.g. environmental pollution). Much of the Bangladeshi population are also vulnerable in socio-economic terms due primarily to widespread poverty. In this context we ask, albeit sceptically, whether there is any chance of holding corporations to account for their environmental responsibilities. Using the notions of vulnerability and ecological rifts we answer this question by providing evidence from published sources and a series of 32 semi-structured interviews with Bangladeshi stakeholder groups. Key findings include, inter alia, corporate reluctance to take responsibility for the environmental impact of their activities. Our interviewees discuss the possibility of a role for mandatory corporate reporting in enhancing corporate accountability and we argue that this is essential if the contradictions and irrationalities of the globalized capitalist system are to be made visible. Achieving such accountability, however, will not be easy due to a lack of political will and the prohibitive costs involved. Incurring such costs could raise the dangerous prospect of Bangladesh losing business to other, less regulated, economies. © 2015 The Authors.","Bangladesh; Corporations; Ecological rifts; Environmental accountability; Vulnerability",,"Belal, A.R.; Accounting Group, United Kingdom; email: a.r.belal@aston.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

We argue that it is important that sustainability accounts codify, using culturally relevant media, language and objects/symbols, the causes of a community's unsustainability in order to enable the exploration of more sustainable ways of living. The co-production of accounts with those seeking to provide locally relevant solutions is also an important aspect of sustainability accounting.

We offer insights into this debate by presenting a qualitative case study of the tax planning arrangements of one multinational company that uses transfer pricing to achieve significant tax savings. We contrast this arrangement with an analysis of how the company discussed taxation in its disclosures over a 10-year period, and set its arrangements against the CSR claims made by the company during this time. Despite its claimed commitment to accurate and transparent communication, the company has made only limited disclosures on taxation, and issues such as tax planning, tax risks and tax compliance have been omitted completely. By juxtaposing the legal tax planning arrangements of the company being studied with its lack of tax disclosures and apparent neglect of its own CSR commitments, we highlight how corporate taxation needs to be considered to be a CSR issue. Moreover, given that the disclosures of powerful social actors affect how issues such as corporate tax avoidance and responsible taxation are understood and subsequently acted upon in society, we consider it essential to analyse in detail what corporations actually say in their disclosures. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Corporate social reporting; Corporate social responsibility; Tax avoidance; Transfer pricing",,"Laine, M.; Department of Political and Economic Studies, Finland; email: matias.laine@uta.fi",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the (ab)use of three CSR reporting practices: the use of stand-alone reports, assurance, and reporting guidance. These practices may be the outcome of a substantive approach to CSR undertaken to carry out duties of accountability to stakeholders, or conversely they could represent symbolic actions intended to portray corporations as genuinely committed to CSR. Thus, we investigate the use of these three practices in relation to disclosure proxies that capture the quality of disclosure along three different yet complementary dimensions: the content of the information disclosed (what and how much is disclosed), the type of information used to describe and discuss CSR issues (how it is disclosed) and the managerial orientation (the corporate approach to CSR). We find that, on average, companies that use these practices do not provide a higher quality of information, which we interpret as evidence of a symbolic use of these practices. Nevertheless, for those companies providing performance-related disclosures, we obtain limited evidence indicating that disclosures by GRI followers are more likely to be balanced, comparable and precise. Overall, our evidence supports increasing scepticism about the use of CSR reporting practices as tools used to enhance perceived accountability. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Accountability; Critical; Disclosure quality; Legitimacy theory; Reporting practices; Sustainability",,"Ricceri, F.; Department of Economics and Management, Via del Santo, Italy; email: federica.ricceri@unipd.it",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

However, critical academic examinations of this model have been remained scarce and most importantly, no real alternatives have been developed. Thus this theoretical paper provides a contribution to fill this gap. Through a critical analysis of the TBL, we argue that it suffers from severe limitations. In particular, it does not protect human and natural capital (HNC). As an answer to these problems, we propose and discuss another accounting framework, the 'Triple Depreciation Line' (TDL), which extends to HNC the powerful capitalist accounting tool for preserving financial capital - the historical cost accounting (HCA) and its planned depreciation. To this end, we analyse and (re-)define the concept of capital in an ecological accounting context. We clearly specify the assumptions on which the TDL relies, to facilitate comparisons or dialogues with other accounting models and to avoid misunderstanding as in the case of the TBL. These axioms concern what we call the 'social' (axioms SA1-2) and 'corporate' (axioms AA1-4) capital maintenance. While the two first appeal to the most precise ontological investigation possible of HNC, the others imply mainly the recourse to the HCA and its depreciation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Capital; Depreciation; Integrated reporting; Triple Bottom Line",,"Rambaud, A.72 rue Maurice Ripoche, France; email: alexandre.rambaud@dauphine.fr",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

An ethnographic approach was adopted, in which the researcher was immersed in the life of the selected case organisation over an extended period of time. This research extends a thin literature on the topic of management control and culture in the Indonesian context. Also, this paper fills a gap in the theoretic approaches for studying bureaucracy, which is dominated by western conceptualisations.

For those within the telecom company, the ethos of public service could not withstand the message of capitalism with its rhetorical call for greater efficiency, effectiveness and consumer awareness.

Overall, we contribute to the accounting literature on journal rankings by reflecting on their impact on researchers' identities. Our personal narratives illustrate how journal rankings, embedded in a research incentive policy, can fragment and politicize junior faculties' identities, driving them, professionally and intellectually, into contradictory directions and throwing them into academic politics. In terms of sustainability, identity fragmentation and identity politicization are ambivalent processes. They can marginalize junior researchers who do not have the political skills required to play the games of academic politics and discourage those who feel trapped in identity conflicts. On the other hand, identity fragmentation and politicization can also stimulate a deeper form of reflexivity and action. Through increased awareness of self and the political stakes of the field, junior researchers might be able to promote greater diversity and respond actively to the needs of a sustainable accounting research environment. © 2014.","Accounting research; Autoethnography; Identity; Journal ranking; Sustainability",,"Malsch, B.; Queen's School of Business, 143 Union Street, Office 415, Canada",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The Guide offers a one size fits all formula for estimating the quality of journal articles and journals. This approach disadvantages emergent journals and areas of interest. It contributes to a wider debasement of academic culture whereby business schools and academics are encouraged to over-focus on issues of status and league table positioning for their own sake, rather than address important issues of concern to our wider society.

Criticism of the ABS Guide has distracted attention from the results of successive RAEs, where the panel for Business and Management has been one of the most selective in its allocation of the highest grades, especially when compared with the neighbouring field of Economics. If the ABS Guide had been used to grade outputs submitted for Business and Management in the RAE 2008 then many more outputs would have received the highest grades, especially in accounting where outputs from journals such as Critical Perspectives on Accounting, which are highly rated in the ABS Guide, appear to have been downgraded by the RAE panel. The alleged bias against accounting in the ABS Guide rests on a particular interpretation of citation impact factors for journals, and a narrow definition of subject fields. Critics of the ABS Guide would be better advised to direct their attention to scrutinizing the results of the REF and considering whether it provides an adequate research ranking for UK business schools. 15% of all full time students in the UK study business and management, including accounting and finance, but only 6.7% of the full time equivalent research active staff submitted in the RAE 2008 were in business and management, or accounting and finance. Research audits are therefore forcing the separation of teaching from research in UK business schools. With an estimated ratio of 71 full time students per research active faculty member in UK business schools, it may be time to consider a more appropriate, inclusive, and economical form of ranking for research in business and management. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Accounting journals; Critical; Journal rankings; Research audit; United Kingdom",,"Rowlinson, M.; School of Business and Management, Mile End Road, United Kingdom",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Too often, this is a sterile 'debate' and in accounting especially, the actual lack of real debate is destructive - manifest as it is in the pernicious attachment of key academic journals to a single (and largely unexamined) notion of what comprises good research and consequently what is permitted as knowledge. This restriction has additional unanticipated consequences in that it (a) refuses to acknowledge research findings that appear in journals other than those anointed by the high priests of self-styled positivism and (b) it severely limits the research questions that can be addressed to only those which can be perceived and addressed through a narrow array of method (Chua, 1986). We argue that such a position is untenable as well as undesirable and, following Feyerabend and Morgan (as well as Caldwell, McCloskey and Tashakkori &amp; Teddlie), argue for pluralism in method choice grounded in a pragmatic philosophy driven firstly by a concern for the research problem, and an absence of a fact-value distinction. We suggest that such pluralism is especially important in an area concerned with social and environmental issues which, ultimately, are matters of life and death and more important than trivial matters of 'which method is best' (or perhaps - more accurately - which method is permitted in journal X). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Critical; Environmental; Social",,"Gray, R.; School of Management, United Kingdom; email: rhg1@st-andrews.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Dixon School of Accounting, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL  32816, United States","During its relatively brief, 40-year life as a recognized field of inquiry (Owen, 2008), research in social and environmental accounting (SEA) has witnessed its fair share of struggles within both the mainstream and critical accounting literature. Only recently, the elite mainstream academic journals in the United States have (re)discovered SEA-related work on corporate social responsibility, and in a vast majority of that work, earlier SEA studies are either not acknowledged (e.g., Elliott, Jackson, Peecher, & White, 2014) or are dismissed as irrelevant to the discussion at hand (e.g., Moser & Martin, 2012). Critical accounting research has been more welcoming generally to SEA topics, although there has been near constant tension between the reformist approach taken in many SEA studies and the more radical tenor understandably present in critical research (e.g., Spence, 2009; Tinker et al., 1991). At certain points in the development of SEA research, common ground has been found (Tinker & Gray, 2003). Grappling with these dilemmas seems especially acute for quantitative SEA work that follows an objectivist/positivist research tradition, often facing increasing methodological hurdles from the elite mainstream, and/or a rejection of fundamental assumptions by critical theorists.The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we offer support for sustaining diversity in SEA research by discussing the potential for quantitative SEA research projects to substantively challenge mainstream conceptions of SEA. Second, in order to promote quantitative SEA research we present a literature review that informs current and potential quantitative SEA scholars of recent developments in this stream of research, focusing primarily on the methodological requirements present in related mainstream quantitative research. Although admittedly partial and selective in its presentation, through this commentary we aim to promote continued support of quantitative SEA research within the critical accounting community and to help enable non-mainstream quantitative SEA researchers to disarm methodological criticisms from elite mainstream sources. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Corporate social responsibility; Environmental accounting; Quantitative research; Social accounting; Sustainability",,"Roberts, R.W.; Kenneth G.

This pedagogy initiates a disorienting dilemma by contrasting accounting's economic rationalism with sustainability's ecological resilience. It then enables learners to discover deeper layers of this tension in a student-centred participatory learning environment: learners harness their emotional intelligence to critically evaluate accounting's financial perspective, and expand their consciousness of the other. A case-study on the lived-experiences and perceptions of two consecutive cohorts of accounting students sheds light on how and why this pedagogy contributed to five (of ten) graduates interviewed reconsidering their existing moral consciousness and professional identities, four graduates reinforcing their prevailing sustainability perspectives, and one graduate, with language difficulties, maintaining accounting's financial perspective. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Accounting education; Critical; Sustainability; Transformative Learning",,"Saravanamuthu, K.; Newcastle Business School, Australia; email: Kalathevi.Saravanamuthu@newcastle.edu.au",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

It argues that everyday accounting practices are deeply implicated in the inequitable distribution of income and wealth, a major cause of the economic crisis engulfing the neoliberal economies. Without adequate purchasing power middle and low income households cannot make the purchases necessary for a sustained revival of the economic activity. Accounting calculations and discourses play a major role in the determination of wages and taxes. They prioritise the interests of capital over labour and the state and have systematically eroded labour's share of the gross domestic product. At the same time, despite a massive growth in corporate profitability, the UK state's share of the national wealth in the form of tax revenues has also declined. It is argued that accounting practices which label payment of wages to labour and payment of taxes to the state as 'costs' amplify capitalist concerns about private appropriation of surpluses and have played a major role in assigning such payments to negative spaces. Through the sale of tax avoidance schemes to corporations and wealthy elites, accountancy firms have facilitated a skewed distribution of income of wealth and further constrained the state's capacity to reflate the economy. Consequently, the tax burdens on the less well-off have increased and further eroded their purchasing power and possibilities of building a sustainable economy. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Accounting firms; Critical; Inequalities; Public sector; Taxation",,"Sikka, P.; Centre for Global Accountability, Essex Business School, University of EssexUnited Kingdom",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

It adopts a Marxist theoretical perspective concentrating mainly on Marx's work on fictitious capital. Fictitious capital is any form of investment (for example bonds, stocks, derivatives, and collateralized debt obligations) which is based upon the expectation of future returns. According to Marx while fictitious capital is useful to capitalism, it cannot create value - only human labour can do that. The recent crisis was exacerbated by the significant amounts of investment which were made in extreme forms of fictitious capital. The paper argues that the accounting profession's adoption of financial economic rationalities meant that it helped to animate the form of financialised neo-liberalism which dominated at the time of the crisis. The accounting profession and accounting academia have implemented and propagated technologies and rationalities which enabled, legitimised, and drove the activities of business in general and financial institutions in particular in the run up to and since the crisis. While, accounting could be seen as being complicit in the crisis, it is important to remember that it was a capitalist crisis. The intuitional structures of accounting mean that it is susceptible of being captured by the most powerful in society. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Critical; Marx; Public interest Capitalism; Social",,"Cooper, C.United Kingdom",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Our focus is the discipline of finance - as a field of practices and a field of research - in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis. Our exploratory analysis indicates difficulties in concretizing substantive change in both fields, although difficulties do not imply absolute inertia and structural inalterability. In particular, we found indications that, apart from a few exceptions, the core of finance research has largely failed to invest in the promotion of paradigmatic diversity, and continues to resist the idea. Yet, the stakes involved are significant, since finance's lack of diversity in research paradigms arguably translates into a body of knowledge that presents important limitations when trying to make sense of important phenomena, not least of which are infrequent but highly significant events unfolding in the political economy. Although we are aware of the underlying obstacles, we maintain that there is a need for finance academics to increase their commitment to research diversity and engage more thoroughly in the examination of finance in action. While the development of behavioral finance constitutes an interesting intellectual ramification, which allows the field to experiment in relaxing the assumption of investor rationality, a stronger engagement in diversifying knowledge, paradigmatically and methodologically, is needed for richer and grounded understandings of finance in action to concretize. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Epistemology of finance; Finance research; Global financial crisis; Public policy; Research diversity; Substantive change",,"Gendron, Y.; Faculté des sciences de l'administration, Pavillon Palasis-Prince, Université Laval, 2325, rue de la Terrasse, Local 6224, Canada",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Our focus is how the prescriptive arrangement of information constrains personalization possibilities and shifts, partially but significantly, the power of framing NGO representations into funders' hands. Out of this process emerges a representation of NGOs as ""financially inclined performers"", which aim to deliver results as defined by funders. CIDA is found to diffuse normative views on what NGOs ought to be and do, thereby constructing a sense of reality that privileges (economic) performance over social imperatives. Our study illustrates how meaning creation, an ""unobtrusive device"", is a constituent of funders' disciplinary arsenal, which reifies a political discourse that conceives of NGOs' role as performers that deliver aid technically and narrowly - certainly not in an adaptive way.

One critical element of human endeavour is business, leading to the proposition the primary objective of business is to contribute to happiness, with profit being a means towards this end. This central idea linking business and the pursuit of happiness is used to critique the capability of accounting to contribute to lofty objectives leading to the central question if the goal of business should be the pursuit of human happiness, can accounting contribute to this goal?The notion of happiness is explored by comparing hedonism with Aristotle's eudaimonism, leading to a comparison between the conceptual underpinnings of eudaimonistic happiness and the Buddhist concept of nirvana. The shaky conceptual ground on which accounting is built is exposed by its opposition to the fundamental nature of reality as described by the four seals of Dharma which describe the central truths of Buddhist philosophy. The critique of accounting is performed across the seven themes of truth, time, dualism, objectivism, interconnectedness, morality and measurability. The paper concludes by identifying the equivalent philosophical assumptions which underpin both critical accounting and Buddhism, confirming the relevance of a Buddhist critique to accounting. © 2014.","Buddhism; Critical; Happiness; Social",,"Lamberton, G.; School of Business, Southern Cross University, Locked Mail Bag 4 Coolangatta, Australia",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Classic works of art from The Netherlands, for example, depict the settling of accounts as not only a personal but a civic virtue-as a critical factor in the nation's development and prosperity. In that light it is not surprising that today's anti-corruption groups often see accounting and accountants as obvious parts of the reform repertoire, and as more or less inevitably helping produce better government. But the early successes of accounting had as much to do with the interests and interactions of a small class of elites as with any inherent redemptive qualities of the techniques themselves. A similar logic applies to the contemporary anti-corruption uses of accounting: because the techniques themselves can serve and conceal all manner of interests and agendas, their effectiveness in controlling corruption will depend upon support from active and sustainable reform constituencies. Skilled and rigorous accounting techniques can become a powerful anti-corruption force, but active support from elites and citizens alike must demand that they be dedicated to that agenda. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Corruption; Public interest",,"Johnston, M.; Department of Political Science, Colgate UniversityUnited States",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

A major reason for this is the supply of corruption by corporations keen to secure lucrative contracts. Within the spirit of contemporary capitalism, they have an insatiable appetite for profits and have shown willingness to engage in corrupt practices to secure government departments.

Therewith the paper seeks to develop an analysis of corruption and corruption prevention among elites (Neu et al, 2015) in two ways. First it adopts Foucault's analysis of 'illegalism' in Discipline and Punish (1977: 82ff), wherein corruption ceases to be a negative-the 'unlawful' counterposed to 'law' as positive-as law itself becomes destabilised, framed by different forms of illegalism: 'illegalisms of property' for the poor leading to imprisonment, 'illegalisms of rights' for the powerful which go unchallenged. It suggests that elite corruption now supplements its use of the latter illegalisms through recourse to expert discourses of '. hyper-legalism', increasingly entailing a 'skilful accounting' (Neu et al, 2015). Second, Neu et al propose that corruption's prevention may be effected by a modern Foucauldian 'ethical and disciplined subject'. However Foucault's analysis of modern self-formation in The Birth of Biopolitics (2008: 219ff) suggests this may prove problematic. The Human Capitalist subject is there an 'abilities machine' and 'entrepreneur of one's self'. As 'abilities machine' it is 'disciplined', forming itself within the 'truth games' of today's 'double disciplinarity', sc. involving self-engagement with both disciplinary conduct and disciplinary expertise. As 'self-entrepreneur' it may also, formally, be 'ethical' (cf. Dilts, 2011), based on Foucault's own classification of the aspects of that relation (Foucault, 1987b). But substantively its 'ethicality' may entail ploys of hyper-legalism and skilful accounting, leading to corruption's continuance as well. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Corruption; Ethics; Public interest",,"Hoskin, K.; Essex Business School, University of Essex, Wivenhoe Park, United Kingdom",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Specifically focusing on corruption in government procurement and drawing on the insights of Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze, the paper proposes that effective anti-corruption practices depend upon an understanding and analysis of the practices and politics of visibility, and that effective 'luminous arrangements' have the potential to discourage corrupt practices and influence ethics within organizations. While such arrangements do not necessarily prevent corrupt practices, they do encourage certain actions and reactions among organizational actors, suggesting that organizational actors are at one and the same time free and autonomous, yet subject to and constructed by anti-corruption practices. These practices are thus both disciplinary and productive, affecting individuals in specific ways, while also benefitting the organizations for whom they work. © 2014.","Corruption; Deleuze; Ethics; Foucault; Government procurement; Internal controls",,"Neu, D.; Schulich School of Business, York University, 4700 Keele Street, Canada",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The paper draws on both Foucault and Lacan's account of the formation of the subject to explore the 'mad' attractions of corruption. The analysis suggests that the attraction of corruption lies not only in the private material advantage it offers but also in the enjoyment and excitement that arises, both from the exercise of quasi-sovereign power within hierarchies, and from transgression of the very rules that hierarchy is formally constituted to enforce. The phantasies of omnipotence and absolute autonomy that animate corrupt subjectivity are further reinforced by subordinates who are too eager to win the recognition of the powerful, or at least too paranoid to overtly challenge their corrupt conduct.

Agency theory prevailed in Chinese language studies of CER in China whereas institutional theory was more popular in English language studies.Theoretical foundation of CER research relating to China needs to be more sensitive to the efficacy of transporting Western-based theories to the Chinese context. We draw attention to the potential of using institutional theory to frame analysis of Chinese CER.

The goalposts in Irish PPPs appear to be changing in favour of the private partner at the expense of the taxpayers, who are the losers in the PPP game. The Government are also suggesting that they may potentially step in, if projects experienced financial difficulty and the special purpose vehicle (SPV) may require specific guarantees in order to participate in future PPP projects. Pricing of demand risk also differs from the Government's rhetoric that it is being priced realistically. In practice, we find that it is priced aggressively by the SPV in order to win PPP contracts.

The analysis shows that the management accounting discourse becomes the dominating ideology which is embedded in the public rhetorical debate. There are three peculiar outcomes of this domination; the absence of physicians in the general public debate, the creation of a phantom phenomenon meaning that the negative consequences of the reform are blamed on a third person, typically the system, and finally a changing meaning of the health care service quality provided from a medical perspective of a patient oriented focus to a quantitative focus through strong rationalised arguments.

We document the social mechanisms of symbolic domination that secure the Big Four's position in the social structure of professional accounting firms. We identify a circular system of double-structured domination, where three mechanisms of euphemised discourse, rites of institution and socialisation normalise symbolic systems and disabling constraints for smaller firms. In addition to interviewing informants working in the field, this paper examines recent political challenges that have placed the role of the Big Four and their domination under increasing scrutiny. These challenges bring into focus issues of recognition and resistance to symbolic modes of domination, and we contemplate the impact of such discourses on the dynamics of the UK accounting field, and the Big Four's continued influence. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Big Four; Bourdieu; Domination; Symbolic power; Symbolic violence",,"Stringfellow, L.; University of Exeter Business School, Rennes Drive, United Kingdom",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The application of business thinking to the public sector has meant conceptualising the sovereign debt management function as a corporate-style controller function, applying to sovereign debt management the asset and liability management techniques developed in the banking sector. Accruals-based appropriations and outcomes-focused strategy statements weaken a legislature's power of control over the executive government and divert attention from the control of public finance, which increasingly appears to be delegated to the executive government. Wider application of the asset and liability management techniques adopted for sovereign debt management seems to support an emergent capital market development strategy, facilitated by increasing government participation in capital markets.

This paper suggests that different aspects of competition independently affect honesty in managerial reporting: economic competition affects the economic benefits of lying, while rivalry diminishes the moral costs of lying. Based on recent findings from social psychology and experimental economics on a gender gap in competitiveness, the study further hypothesizes that the effects of competition on honesty differ across gender. A laboratory experiment was conducted, in which participants had to report cost information in a participative budgeting context under different competitive and non-competitive conditions. Results indicate that an individual's willingness to report honestly decreases significantly when rivalry is introduced, even if the economic benefits of lying remain constant. In contrast, economic competition only diminished the salience of honesty preferences of male participants in the experiment. In conclusion, corporate managers who wish to take advantage of the positive effects of competition, such as increased motivation and efficiency in capital allocation processes, should not only focus on its economic effects but also be aware of its potential negative impact. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Competition; Honesty; Managerial reporting; Rivalry",,"Schreck, P.; Institute of Managerial Accounting, Ludwig-Maximilians-University MunichGermany",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

At the centre of the reorganization was the creation of a business unit of limited potential to separate asbestos long-tail liabilities from the profitable operations of the corporate group and locate the risk in an alternate legal arena.

This return to the text is intended as a clarification of what Foucault actually says on this matter and an assessment of how far it can be regarded as authoritative. The major conclusions are as follows.The subject matter of Foucault's 'discursive' phase is not discourse in its generality but islands of organization ('discursive formations') within it. To all intents and purposes these are bodies of knowledge and Foucault's focus is on those which he calls 'human sciences'. His concern is to show that these can be understood as a rule-governed systems of discursive events. The alternative of an action-theoretic account is ruled out by Foucault's declared intention of avoiding recourse to a concept of human agency. Thus Foucault does not theorize discourse as an expression of human subjectivity. Rather he theorizes the subject as an image of the human being which is produced by, and presumed in, self-organizing systems of knowledge.In Foucault's work up to and including the Archaeology of Knowledge, therefore, the discursively constructed subject is not a flesh-and-blood human being at all. It is a thought-object constructed by, and within, the human sciences. Because there are a number of human sciences there are a corresponding number of constituted subjects, each of which, in the first instance, has currency only within its parent knowledge. In Foucault's earlier Order of Things, however, a unitary 'contemporary subject' is theorized as a composite of these constructs. Since the constituting discourses are depicted as evolving autonomously, Foucault is thus able to produce a history of 'the different modes by which human beings are made subjects'.All this means that any support from Foucault for the idea that subjectivities are discursively constituted in actuality must rest on Foucault's genealogical phase. In Discipline and Punish, the human sciences are depicted, not as self-organizing fields of knowledge, but as the theoretical arms of various regimes of behavioural correction. Foucault is convincing in his claim that this 'power-knowledge' has diffused outwards from the total institutions in which it was prototyped, thence to become the characteristically modern modality of power. He is much less convincing on the question of its effects. Despite Foucault's talk of 'shaping the soul', in fact, it is not clear that he has anything at all to say about this. The problem is that all of his descriptions of the various disciplinary orders are 'top down' accounts, relying either on the programmes of legal theorists and institutional reformers or on observation of institutional routines by official inspectors. The voice of the inmate is absent entirely, as is any evidence that disciplinary regimes achieve anything more than a calculative conformity to their behavioural dictates.This is not to deny that disciplinary power may impact on subjectivities. The point here is that such an effect needs to be evidenced rather than simply assumed on the basis of (what has been taken to be) Foucault's say-so. In critical accounting, unfortunately, the tendency has been to treat accounting as a discursive system or regime of power-knowledge and then cite Foucault as if this were sufficient to establish that it works through the production of subjectivities. The paper concludes with a discussion of two recent examples, one of which appeals to a concept of discursive constitution and one to the concept of power-knowledge. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Archaeology; Discourse; Discursive constitution; Foucault; Power-knowledge; Subject; Subjectification",,"Armstrong, P.; University of Leicester, The School of ManagementUnited Kingdom",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

This technology of power arose and matured within the Roman Catholic Church and provided a model for many states in the achievement and exercise of power. Informed by the work of Foucault on pastoral power the present work examines the genealogical core of governmentality in the context of the Roman Catholic Church at a time of great crisis in the 15th century when the Roman Catholic Church was undergoing reform instituted by Pope Eugenius IV (1431-1447).

The paper demonstrates that, on its foundation, the IIRC's principal objective was the promotion of sustainability accounting. The IIRC's current approach to sustainability is analyzed on the basis of the Framework which it issued in December 2013. The paper argues that, in the Framework, the IIRC has abandoned sustainability accounting. It bases this conclusion on two considerations: that the IIRC's concept of value is 'value for investors' and not 'value for society'; and that the IIRC places no obligation on firms to report harm inflicted on entities outside the firm (such as the environment) where there is no subsequent impact on the firm. The paper also concludes that the IIRC's proposals will have little impact on corporate reporting practice, because of their lack of force. The paper attributes the IIRC's abandoning of sustainability accounting to the composition of the IIRC's governing council, which is dominated by the accountancy profession and multinational enterprises, which are determined to control an initiative that threatened their established position. In effect, the IIRC has been the victim of 'regulatory capture'. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Capitalism; Environmental; Stakeholder; Sustainability",,"Flower, J.",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The literature provides extensive documentation of the problem and many suggestions for change nonetheless, little change has ensued. In this paper, we draw on the sociology literature to provide a theoretical basis for a programme of structural change. We suggest that there is little merit in researchers seeking to effect incremental change because the current structures are so deep and those with the power to effect change are well served in maintaining these structures. The lesson from the sociology literature, and an application of this literature to accounting research, is that successful structural change almost certainly requires a significant resource shift. It is this resource shift that allows new schema (the underlying beliefs and assumptions) to emerge. There is evidence that such resource shifts precipitated the development of the current structure that shapes accounting research and it is unlikely that significant structural change can be achieved without a similar resource realignment. We call on accounting researchers to shift their attention away from documenting the problem and towards applying pressure to policy-makers to take action. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Accounting research; Duality of structure; Institutional change; Public interest",,"Wilkinson, B.R.; Department of Accounting and Business Law, Baylor University, One Bear Place, United States",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

On the other hand, however, the quest for research orientation seems to bring with it an increased homogenization in our understanding of what good research means and, thus, poses a threat for the diversity of our community.

The paper argues that the language, concepts and methodological focus in the current research framework predominantly derive from the Anglo-Saxon context, and that the dissemination process in international journals marginalizes the research contributions of non-Anglo-Saxon studies, even when the latter are consistent with Anglocentric styles of research. The Anglocentrism of accounting research in the international arena is being further reinforced by institutional changes in academia, legitimizing the English-speaking Western hegemony in the production and distribution of knowledge in the global knowledge economy.

The logical outcome that has followed from this phenomenon is the proliferation of a set of institutional pressures cast on scholars to produce research that will be published in 'journals that count'. One group that has been particularly implicated in the process are doctoral students-a group that is often situated in the most disempowered position within the academic hierarchy. Doctoral students habitually encounter myriad discursive and coercive forces, which encourage them to pursue scholarship within a certain assemblage of paradigmatic boundaries, methodological approaches, and research parameters. While members of this group will eventually become the future of their respective disciplines, their voices have been largely silenced in, or absent from, the ongoing conversation regarding the implications emerging from the current nature of institutional pressures for research output. Focusing on the area of critical research, this article identifies two trajectories by which to reimagine the future of critical doctoral education in business schools: i) reconstituting the role of senior professors in the field whose ontology and scholarship are inflected by a critical orientation, and, ii) pursuing concerted efforts to disengage with the mainstream. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Business school; Doctoral education; Institutional pressures; Journal rankings; Liminality; Scholarship",,"Prasad, A.; EGADE Business School, Tecnológico de Monterrey, Carlos Lazo 100, Santa Fe 03189, Mexico",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The study is unusual in linking the history of a colony with the history of an emerging economy. We argue that colonisers espied economic, social and political benefits of colonialistic acts, and accounting usages were initiated and maturated alongside these, to avail commerce and life's personal dealings, religion-making, and government and public policymaking. Several persisting inadequacies of these accounting usages are revealed. They derive mostly from how asymmetric power relations in various contexts have played important roles in ways that accounting usages were constituted and sustained, and that this continues to be the case. The indigenes have not been accounted to, nor have had ready access to information concerning them. The indigenes have shared in some benefits but only incidentally and invariably down the pecking order. The indigenes have been precluded, befuddled and amazed by the usages, which concomitantly have enabled successive colonisers to re-define, enclose, exploit, subject and neo-liberalise them. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Colonialism; Critical; Pacific development; Praxis",,"Dixon, K.; Department of Accounting and Information Systems, Private Bag 4800, New Zealand",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

It connects this shift to the socio-economic changes that are currently being discussed in the literature on financialisation, e.g. the rise of shareholder value and the proprietary view of the firm. Two ideal-typical accounting systems are constructed on the basis of normative accounting theory and extant standards - historical cost accounting (HCA) and fair value accounting (FVA). The 'accounting revolution' of the past 10-15 years can be understood as a qualitative shift from HCA to FVA. It is further argued that these ideal-typical systems are related to different circuits or forms of capital - productive and money capital respectively - and to the particular perspective that these afford on the, capitalist firm. Inasmuch as financialisation is related to the circuit of money capital one can make sense of the rise to prominence of FVA, which represents the dominance of a financial view of the firm in the field of financial accounting. Throughout this paper, however, the limits to financialisation are also highlighted and traced back to the ineradicable manifestation of the circuit of productive capital. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Accounting change; Critical; Financialization; IFRS; Political economy; Social",,"Müller, J.; Forschungskolleg Postwachstumsgesellschaften, Humboldtstraße 34, Germany",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The purpose of this study is to review how ST has been applied, and can be applied, in this sizeable literature. Overall, the review of some 65 published papers, suggests that not only has ST contributed to challenge the assumptions of 'inherent and functional' features of accounting systems per se characterizing mainstream research, but also to develop other alternative theoretical perspectives. However, our review also suggests several limitations. These include that the accounting community has not really worked as a collective to develop a structurationist understanding of accounting practices, and that most researchers remain largely uncritical to ST as a theory. We also find that accounting scholars have not yet developed a mutual understanding of how to interpret ST (i.e. there are conceptual unclarities and even inconsistencies), or how to apply ST methodologically in empirical research. Based on these limitations, and the identification of a number of 'black spots' in the literature, we suggest several directions for future scholarly effort. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Critical; Giddens; Literature Review; Social; Structuration Theory",,"Englund, H.; Örebro University School of Business, SE-701 82 Örebro, Sweden; email: hans.englund@oru.se",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

ERs (reclaimed enterprises) are businesses that have been brought back into operations as a cooperative by the workers when they were thought to be bankrupt. The commentary presented here focuses primarily on Bryer, but also discusses additional elements that may shed light on the unique phenomenon of ERs. As case studies, ERs provide an ideal context in which to research accounting change and test critical perspectives in accounting. This commentary focuses on the particularities of the socioeconomic environment that became the fertile ground of ERs, while also offering a long-term view of the phenomenon ten years after it was initiated. In particular, it undertakes a comparison between the initial situation and the situation in 2012. The commentary makes two key arguments: first, that accounting is an instrumental technology; and second, that the constructs that existed in 2001 have evolved significantly-and have even become partially obsolete-as diverse management forms emerged in successful ERs. This evolution is analyzed along five dimensions: (1) hierarchical organization; (2) property rights and the concept of profit; (3) community action and its links with access to financial resources; (4) the duality of members and non-members; and (5) the role of accounting reporting and discourse. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Accounting change; Argentina; Critical; Qualitative Research; Social",,"Porporato, M.; York University, School of Administrative Studies, Canada; email: porpomar@yorku.ca",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The paper constructs the methodology by linking together and developing interpretive and labour process perspectives through an analysis of ethnographic material drawn from an extensive field study of the empresas recuperadas - cooperatives formed by workers during economic and political crisis in Argentina in 2001. The analysis traces the involvement of accounting practices within collaborative dynamics that transformed a hierarchical organisational structure, embedded within accountability systems that manifest prevailing notions of identity and collectivism, into a decentralised organisation that established relations with grass roots societal groups informed by new purposes and values. This perspective develops into a concept of the differentiated and contradictory social aspects of profitability, and highlights a range of potential relations between representations and realities. The final part conceptualises the collective and nuanced conditions through which accounting practices represented individual needs more effectively.

We argue that there is scope for researchers to focus on the more concrete aspects of structuration, such as the configuration and articulation of patterns in relations between agents over time. To do so, we advocate the deployment of a position-practice perspective, which comprises four inter-related elements: praxis, positioning, capabilities and trust. We illustrate use of the perspective in a case study of a joint venture between companies engaged in the production and shipment of oil and petroleum products. The position-practice perspective reveals control governed not by equity ownership, but rather a dialectic of control between joint venture partners whose activities are also affected by accountability to powerful institutions in the wider network. Nevertheless, industry practices are mediated by partner organisations, who rely heavily on trust in systems rather than interpersonal trust. Further research is proposed, using composite research strategies, different levels of analysis, and greater diversity in inter-organisational relationships. The position-practice perspective complements previous structuration studies by more clearly focusing on the praxis of situated agents, their positioning relative to others, the stratified pluralism of institutionalised practices, the consequent role of contradiction in social relations, the recursive cycles of disembedding and reembedding that link the local and global, the concrete and the abstract, and the complex and provisional nature of trust in creating order and coordination. © 2012.","Accountability; Critical; Management control; Position-practice relations; Structuration theory",,"Coad, A.F.; Department of Accounting and Finance, , Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, United Kingdom; email: a.f.coad@bham.ac.uk",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The backdrop of this study is the idea that the financial literacy movement goes hand in hand with the financialisation of society. By reporting from a study of financial literacy practices, the aim is to disentangle the notion of financial literacy from the assumption that it is a singular capability that, when gained, will automatically affect people's financial practices. The paper draws on a recent development in literacy research, New Literacy Studies, and on its division into autonomous and ideological definitions of literacy. The empirical illustrations originate from the efforts made to decrease financial illiteracy among Swedish adolescents and the demand for financial literacy in audit committees. Contrary to earlier studies, this paper demonstrates that financial literacy does not merely refer to a character trait that researchers may find lacking among the marginalised actors in society. Financial literacy cannot merely be viewed as the ability to read and write in the language of finance and accounting. Instead, financial literacy is a concept that needs to be situated and studied in practice because the characteristics that constitute financial literacy, or those that apply to it, vary with time and place. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Accounting education; Audit committees; Critical; Financial education; Financial literacy; Financialisation; New Literacy Studies",,"Bay, C.; Department of Business Studies, Box 513, SE-751 20 Uppsala, Sweden; email: charlotta.bay@fek.uu.se",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Neoliberalism requires a commitment to a broad set of ideas about how political economies should operate, and these ideas underpin the transformations of practice in the process of neoliberalisation-both at a technical and conceptual level. Transactions within a neoliberal economy need to be accounted for in a way that accords with this broader set of ideas. Specifically, the growth of accumulation through financial markets has seen a concurrent growth in accounts that both reflects and reproduces finance at its centre. These accounts are more than just reports; they condition our expectations and support the production of further accounts, which in turn reinforce the dominant political economy. Despite the connection between neoliberalism, financialisation and the practice of accounting, the role of accounting in the process of neoliberalisation has received only limited attention. In order to contribute to a deeper understanding of these processes and to the role that accounting plays within them, this paper re-examines the Conceptual Framework (CF) to show how it forms an important part of the architecture of neoliberalism, providing coherence and legitimacy to its key ideas. The current CF project was jointly conducted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), and is positioned within the broader literature on neoliberalism and financialisation. This paper shows how changes in terminology, shifts in notions of income and the popularity of market valuations (fair value accounting) work to normalise the speculative characteristics of financial markets. Through this newly configured globalised CF, the regulatory architecture of accounting may work to sustain the centrality of finance in a post-GFC economy, despite its many deficiencies. © 2012 .","Comprehensive income; Conceptual Framework; Critical; Financialisation; Public interest",,"Zhang, Y.; Discipline of Accounting, , NSW 2006, Australia; email: eagle.zhang@sydney.edu.au",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

After a detailed review of the provenance of the putative shareholder primacy rationale, the study provides an analysis of relevant aspects of the Company Law Review (CLR) process in the UK. This ultimately led to the Companies Act 2006 (CA 2006) which determined that shareholder primacy would be maintained as a key principle of UK company law. The CLR had raised the central question: 'in whose interests should companies be run?' and put forward two alternatives: one based on shareholder primacy, and the other based on balancing the interests of a range of stakeholders. The two alternatives were described as 'enlightened shareholder value' and 'pluralism'. Drawing on interviews with key participants in the CLR process, findings from this study suggest that: the breadth of expertise and opinion represented on the CLR was rather narrow; there was a presumption in favour of the status quo of shareholder primacy; there was a lack of any meaningful discussion of the alternatives and that little or no consideration was given to comparative international evidence. In fact, some key participants expressed a great deal of scepticism about the value of the process. The new form of words governing directors' duties, which finally emerged in legislation, was thought by some to embed the concept of shareholder primacy more firmly than before - arguably reflecting the process of financialization. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Company law; Corporate governance; Critical; Financialization; Public interest",,"Ferguson, J.; Department of Accounting and Finance, Curran Building, Glasgow G4 0LN, Scotland, United Kingdom; email: john.ferguson@strath.ac.uk",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Specifically, we note the evolution of the pharmaceutical industry structure from giant vertically integrated firms, selling patent protected blockbuster products at premium prices, to greater vertical disintegration.

By way of contrast, in using the term 'biotech', we are referring to small speciality pharmaceutical and diagnostics firms. now sources a significant volume of early stage R&amp;D activity externally, through outright acquisitions or alliances, especially with biotechnology firms. Much of the reason for such vertical disintegration is to be found in the fundamental tension experienced between the high R&amp;D spend necessitated by the cost of pharmaceutical innovation and declining returns on this expenditure in terms generating new product sales and FDA approval rates, which have remained broadly constant at an average of 20-35 approvals per year. The new R&amp;D outsourcing strategy has not delivered an increase in marketable drug discoveries or new 'blockbuster' profits. Instead, shareholder returns have been maintained through Big Pharma's decision to distribute cash back to shareholders via share buybacks and dividends (as advocated by Jensen). Thus we conclude that such developments within Big Pharma worldwide are best explained through the lens of a financialisation, as opposed to a resource-based or transaction cost framework. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Big Pharma; Biotech firms; Critical; Financialisation; Public interest",,"Open University, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, United Kingdom",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The droughts of the 1930s were a national emergency which combined with economic depression to cause widespread rural poverty and distress. Governmental responses to the crisis were many and included the establishment of experimental resettlement projects for dislocated families. Operated by liberal, socially progressive agencies, these projects attempted to re-establish farm families on more productive land in less arid areas. One such project was the Red River Valley Farms Project in North Dakota. Here, business and home planning, budgeting and record keeping by client families was compulsory. Drawing on the notion of the 'heroic bureaucracy', this historical study reveals accounting as a key facilitative technology in the recovery phase of a disaster. The comprehensive accounting records maintained by each family contributed to their successful resettlement and provided the government agency with copious data for monitoring the performance of the project, measuring the progress of its participants, and identifying where support was most needed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Accounting; Drought; Heroic bureaucracy; North dakota; Recovery; Resettlement",,"Walker, S.P.; University of Edinburgh Business School, 29 Buccleuch Place, United Kingdom",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Accounting systems can be used to track and account for the fair and transparent management of disaster specific funds, giving visibility to the recovery process and its outcomes. However previous studies suggest that the process of accounting, with its individualizing effects, may create ""distance"" between the accountor and the accountee, thereby undermining accountability.This paper investigates the social aspects of the accounting system used by authorities in charge of the recovery from the devastating Italian flood of November 2010. We found that accounting procedures activated after this disaster not only gave visibility to flood damages and recovery actions, but also favored a sense of inter-dependency between all of the players involved. Accounting fostered dialogue, mutual understanding, trust and solidarity among victims, who played a crucial role in enabling the overall accountability process. Our paper provides evidence of the socializing effects of accounting in natural disaster contexts, thereby opening up an interesting area for further research in the streams of critical accounting. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Accountability process; Calculative practices; Dialogue; Natural disaster recovery",,"Lai, A.; Business Administration Department, University of VeronaItaly",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

A breach of levees and the subsequent flooding of the city of New Orleans resulted in the displacement of more than 250,000 people. The death toll exceeded 1800 persons and total damages were estimated to exceed $125 billion. The response to the hurricane by city, state and the federal governments has been severely criticized by many commentators. The purpose of this paper is to examine breakdowns in accountability during and after the storm which were manifested by a lack of communication between government officials and a failure on the part of officials to act responsibly on behalf of victims, many of whom were poor, black and elderly. We also examine whether the breakdown in accountability may be traceable to institutional racism embedded in the history and geography of the city of New Orleans. Following McKernan's (2012) argument, the paper reinforces the need to go beyond a ""calculative accountability"" toward ""the potential of accountability to enhance levels of responsibility for the other"" (p. 259). It is this moral aspect to the concept of accountability that was sorely lacking in the response of government officials to Hurricane Katrina. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Accountability; Critical; Environmental; Hurricane; Social",,"Baker, C.R.; School of Business, Adelphi UniversityUnited States",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

It also provides a critical assessment of the interplay between downward, upward (or hierarchical) and internal (or identity) accountability. It questions whether the concept of 'downward accountability' loses meaning when applied to the published special-purpose disaster recovery reports of the organizations leading the recovery effort. Document analysis is undertaken on the traits of downward accountability displayed in the text and images published in the disaster recovery reports of the controlling government authority, a government/NGO partnership coordinating the appeals fund and three separate participating Christian-denominated NGOs. These report traits include readability by, closeness to and empowerment of beneficiaries. Subsequent interviews with senior financial and communications executives of these organizations shed light on the motivation for the preparation of the recovery reports. The findings have implications concerning the problematization of downward accountability. The appearance of downward accountability traits in these reports appears to be an artifact of the motivation for upward and internal accountability. Moreover, downward accountability through the mode of charitable deeds-based recovery actions seems to be devoid of principal-agent expectations. For these reasons, in the context of a natural disaster, downward accountability does not sit well, conceptually, in a stakeholder-oriented accountability typology framework. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Closeness; Downward accountability; Empowerment; Natural disaster; Non-government organizations; Readability; Site of audiencing",,"Taylor, D.; School of Accounting, RMIT University, Level 11, 445 Swanston Street, Australia",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The paper identifies cultural dialogues through an analysis of comments letters submitted to the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in response to their '. complexity of corporate reporting' discussion paper. To understand how a particular solution has been arrived at when an accounting or auditing issue is reviewed, the debates that precede the outcome need unscrambling by reference to cultural dialogues and the analysis of the comments letters reveals the voices of the different solidarities as they seek to persuade others of the validity of their way of life.

Internal auditing developed from the metamorphosis of capitalism during the twentieth century, when capital gradually succeeded in institutionalizing structural control of labor processes to address the problem of control in inherently antagonistic capital-labor relationships. In this control context employees, management, and the board of directors are responsible for achieving the required rate of return on capital. With the premise that the literature has not adequately theorized the role of internal auditing in this context, this paper proposes an initial theorization of the role of internal auditing as a mechanism employed by management and the board of directors to control the labor process in the generation and realization of surplus value. Internal audit's assurance services to execute business activities according to management's conceptions, and its advisory services to enhance efficiency and effectiveness, are interpreted within the firm's overarching goal of maximizing the rate of return on capital employed.

The parliamentary context of accounting standard setting in Germany provides a unique opportunity for an examination of lobbyists' and parliamentarians' use of rhetoric in the form of arguments and myths in the presence of an expertise gap between both parties. Lobbyists successfully follow rhetoric strategies of providing knowledge and demonstrating expertise to parliamentarians in the form of using a mixed approach of conceptual and self-referential arguments when expressing a neutral opinion. Apart from their argumentative rhetoric, lobbyists also create myths that transfer knowledge in a more subtle way by employing signifiers that are disentangled from the underlying message to be communicated. Parliamentarians respond by using self-referential arguments in cases where they support the regulatory proposals and enrich their arguments by continuing and amplifying the myths created by lobbyists. Parliamentarians' adoption of these strategies demonstrates the effectiveness of the transfer of knowledge and provides evidence of the strategic exploitation of the expertise gap by lobbyists. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Accounting regulation; Accounting standard setting; Critical; German GAAP; Lobbying; Public interest",,"Hoffmann, S.; Department of Accounting and Auditing, HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management, Jahnallee 59, Germany",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The data obtained from focus group interviews suggests that shame-related emotions have an important deterrent effect on the propensity to re-offend arising not from incarceration but from the reflexivity arising from family support and unity. Second, this paper critically evaluates the issues relating to professional reintegration in which members may be barred from practising their trade when they are released from prison. Banning members from professional membership because of their ex-convict label represents a form of exclusionary stigma that contributes to stigmatic shaming and resentment towards the institutions that impose such penalties.

In this paper, we explore the role of interest-discourse in the discursive strategies of legitimization in the audit field. We develop an Ethnomethodologically informed Discourse Analysis (EDA) perspective that enables us to theorise how institutional actors account for interests as a means for de-legitimization and re-legitimization. We ask: how do institutional actors in the audit field establish who or what is 'above the fray' and who or what is 'interested'? We illustrate our argument by examining how the 'Big Four' audit firms handled a 'crisis of legitimacy' in the accountancy profession following the recent financial crisis, focussing in particular on a Parliamentary inquiry into market concentration in the audit industry in the UK. First, we show how de-legitimization is achieved through the discursive strategies of stake attribution, stake interrogation and stake mis-alignment. Second, we show how re-legitimization is achieved through the discursive strategies of stake inoculation, stake confession, stake alignment and stake transcendence. We conclude by examining the implications of the discursive processes we have studied for the future of the audit field in the UK. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Audit; Discourse analysis; Institutional theory; Interests; Legitimacy; Stake",,"Whittle, A.; Chair of Management and Organizations, Newcastle University Business School, 5 Barrack Road, St James, United Kingdom",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Studies accentuate the unstable, fragile nature of HORs and the importance of directing attention to how these arrangements are formed and how and why they change. The aim in this study is to explore control problems of HORs and to discuss how different problems are related to accounting and control initiatives. A theoretical framework with the core concepts of framing and overflow is used as a theoretical point of departure. The empirical study is a longitudinal case study of the organization of a shared service center. In this study, we observe the problems of risk and coordination often discussed in the literature. However, guided by our theoretical framework, we also observe how many problems were formative and related to the forming of actors, relations and products. This study adds to the literature by conceptualizing how accounting and control not only functioned as framing devices, but also became sources of overflows, causing destabilization. Following the conceptual framework, we observe how overflow was caused both through reconnecting what had previously been separated and through cutting off relations in the process of disentangling the HOR. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Framing; Management control; Overflow; Public sector",,"Kastberg, G.; Department of Service Management, Lund UniversitySweden",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The AMH advances a theoretical basis for a new financial paradigm which can better model such phenomena as the recent financial crisis. The AMH regards the financial market order as evolving, tentative and defined by creative destruction in which trading strategies are introduced, mutate to survive, or face abandonment. The concept of investor rationality is less helpful than the distinction between investment strategies which are more or less well adapted to the prevailing market environment. We outline how a more systematic and grounded basis for behavioural finance can be developed in line with the latter approach. Based on this we develop testable hypotheses allowing the AMH to be distinguished from the EMH. Finally, we discuss how the AMH can aid our understanding of important issues in finance. A central insight is that in the survival of richest, as opposed to fittest, implied by the AMH there is much room for misallocation of resources as price and value uncouple. In this shifting financial market order the regulatory State features as a further market in which the vote market verifies or disrupts market conditions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptive market hypothesis; Critical; Efficient market hypothesis; Public interest",,"Hudson, R.; R.Hull University Business School, University of HullUnited Kingdom",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

We address the matter through the lens of crises theoretically capable of undermining neoliberalism's legitimacy. Specifically, we aim to better understand the manufacturing of consent to the neoliberal agenda of state privatization. We study the falsification of Greek public accounts as revealed in 2010, relying on empirical material, such as journalistic statements and reports from international institutions. Our analysis indicates that, although the Greek crisis provided an opportunity to question key aspects of contemporary state management, including the practice by governments of creative finance, the main problematizing trajectories articulated in both the media and political arenas did not destabilize but consolidated neoliberalism. In particular, we illustrate how discursive activity favors the emergence of a collective interpretation of crises that perpetuates the hold of neoliberalism over the social and political realms.

However, the complexity and raw nature of these data, along with the sidelining of professional auditors, will result in most citizens being either unable or unwilling to undertake this task. As such, the proposed 'synoptical' approach will not materialise. Indeed, other legislative changes will mean that outsourcing firms effectively become the new, unaccountable observers of local public sector bodies within an enduring panoptical system.

Our theoretical framework is derived from institutional theory. We develop this by complementing isomorphism (. DiMaggio and Powell, 1983) with an emphasis on the behavior of actors and with the different strategic responses that organizations enact as a result of the institutional pressures toward conformity, following Oliver (1991). We contend that local actors play a more important role in triggering organizational responses than is implied by Oliver's (1991) framework in the application of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). This is because organizational responses to these global standards are conditioned by the interplay between actors, who are searching for legitimacy and the attainment of their own (mutually conflicting) interests.Contrary to earlier institutional propositions, we find that acquiescence strategies may occur even when there is a great degree of constituent multiplicity, and that avoidance may occur in entities with a smaller degree of multiplicity. We thus argue that countries are not homogeneous in terms of accounting practices. Finally we suggest that intra-organizational interests and actions are important for IFRS implementation, and future research should investigate this in depth. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Accountability; Critical; IFRS; Institutional theory; Social",,"Albu, C.N.; The Bucharest University of Economic Studies, Faculty of Accounting and Management Information Systems, 6 Piaa Romană Sector 1, Romania",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Much of the ensuing research, however, has focused more on technical evaluations of these programmes and less on informing our knowledge of the interaction between such programmes and accountants. As public sector accountants (PSAs) are central entities in such programmes, the purpose of this paper is to focus on the reconfiguration of their identities. Using the theoretical lens of Actor-Network-Theory (ANT) and its concept of translation, this study seeks to explain how PSAs' identities were transformed through the introduction of Accrual Output-Based Budgeting (AOBB) in two German states. Our analysis shows that the change of accounting regime was not a straightforward one, but rather involved that accountants faced particular challenges responding to several interessement devices that were used to enrol them into the new practices. We link this behaviour to a Weberian facet of the PSAs' identity, which prevented serious project stagnancy and 'strategies of total resistance', but also precluded many accountants from enrolling easily into AOBB, or even developing enthusiasm. The paper suggests that several groups of accountants, rather than one, experienced different challenges in aligning with AOBB and that each assumed their compromises and investments in developing with accrual accounting. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Accrual accounting and budgeting; Actor-Network-Theory; Identity; New Public Management; Public sector",,"Becker, S.D.; HEC Paris, Department of Accounting and Control, 1 rue de la Libération, 78351 Jouy en Josas, France; email: becker@hec.fr",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

More recently, a new focus on governance systems, under the banner Public Governance (PG), has emerged. In this paper it is argued that reforms are not isolated events, but are embedded in more global discourses of modernisation and influenced by the institutional pressures present in a certain field at certain points in time. Using extensive document analysis in three countries with different administrative regimes (the UK, Italy and Austria), we examine public sector accounting and budgeting reforms and the underlying discourses put forward in order to support the change. We investigate the extent to which the actual content of the reforms and the discourses they are embedded within are connected over time; that is, whether, and to what degree, the reform ""talk"" matches the ""decisions"". The research shows that in both the UK and in Italy there is consistency between the debates and the decided changes, although the dominant discourse in each country differs, while in Austria changes are decided gradually, and only after they have been announced well in advance in the political debate. We find that in all three countries the new ideas and concepts layer and sediment above the existing ones, rather than replace them. Although all three countries underwent similar accounting and budgeting reforms and relied on similar institutional discourses, each made its own specific translation of the ideas and concepts and is characterised by a specific formation of sedimentations. In addition, the findings suggest that, at present in the three countries, the PG discourse is used to supplement, rather than supplant, other prevailing discourses. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Accounting reforms; New public management; Public sector; Sedimentation; Translation",,"Hyndman, N.; Queen's University Management School, Riddle Hall, 185 Stranmillis Road, Belfast BT9 5EE, United Kingdom; email: n.hyndman@qub.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Metaphors applied to materiality provide insights into conditions and traces of power that have shaped its discursive configuration. Rather than viewing materiality as the gradual development of a technical idea over time, metaphorical discourses suggest that it has been constituted as multiple categories of knowledge, with divergent roles, as: a moral responsibility; a solution to the problem of over-auditing; a solid epistemic foundation for financial reporting; a scientific technique; a quantitative rule of thumb; a risk management concept; and a mysterious shield. The malleable nature of the concept has allowed the profession to realign and reinvent it to meet shifting priorities and challenges. Divergence in the trajectories of materiality discourses is relative to certain conditions, events, actors and financial scandals. The paper draws on the metaphor of performance, to interpret materiality as a performative activity at the crux of truth games about making visible, controlling, taming, managing and hiding translation errors in accounting inscriptions.

They examine three key ethical dilemmas that confront modern accounting practice. They examine a set of in-depth interviews, the autobiography of the former Vice President of Internal Audit of WorldCom, Cynthia Cooper, and the documents of the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) to shed light on accounting and audit ethics. The dilemmas confronting the accounting profession are complex and multi-faceted, which they place in their socio-economic context using ideas from Pierre Bourdieu. I add ideas from Lovibond (2004),. MacIntyre (1984) and McDowell (1993) as well as audit work by Jere Francis. My solution involves accountants acting like the phronemos. The phronemos is Aristotle's term for a wise and ethical person who has the capacity to judge and act appropriately. This ideal of the phronemos is used to examine the ethical ambiguities in accounting that involve analyzing the critical role that accounting curricula, education and pedagogy play in making better judgments. This critical accounting focus was also a focus in Chabrak and Craig's work on accounting education. They examined professional credentialing and professional education. Like Everett and Tremblay, they also point us toward the public interest role of accounting and our societal need for better and informed judgments. The comment concludes with the observation that Aristotle's notion of the phronemos is an ideal type that promotes virtue ethics to address the drift in accounting away from ethics and its public interest role. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Critical; Ethics; Moral; Public interest; Virtue ethics",,"Lehman, G.; School of Commerce, University of South Australia, North Terrace Adelaide, AustraliaSchool of Commerce, University of South Australia, North Terrace Adelaide, Australia; email: glen.lehman@unisa.edu.au",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

While accounting researchers have drawn upon Bourdieu's theoretical contributions on habitus, field and capital, little attention has been paid to his later, more critical ideas and practice of intervention post 1995. As a result, accounting research has yet to discover Bourdieu's work on the 'collective intellectual' and, thus, consider its contribution to our understanding of how accounting academics can participate in a form of activism against neoliberalism that would not be in contradiction with professional norms of rigorous research. Rather, activism could enhance academic research.Central to this paper is a reflection on a case of intervention involving a diverse collection of academics and activists who came together to launch a coordinated response to a large-scale industrial disaster in Scotland in 2004. The collective in question took various interventionary steps to campaign for a Public Inquiry into the disaster and seek justice and accountability for workers past and present. These steps are analysed with respect to the methods adopted and the work and practice of Bourdieu's collective intellectual. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Bourdieu; Collective-intellectual; Critical; Public interest; Social",,"Coulson, A.B.; University of StrathclydeUnited Kingdom; email: a.b.coulson@strath.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

An analysis of 42 in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted with experienced internal auditors working in public administration in Quebec indicates that internal auditors perform two key roles: a protector role, further subdivided into two roles, protective shield and keeper of secrets, and a helper role, also subdivided into two roles, support of organizational performance and guide. The analysis also shows that internal auditors have developed a nuanced conception of independence defined as 'grey independence' in order to perform their roles. Internal auditors consider that their primary role is to serve the top manager and the organization and that they must prioritize the top manager at the expense of audit committee members. Therefore, this paper contributes to the literature on internal auditor independence.

Intended to improve system wide custodial outcomes through the introduction of a privately managed operator acting as standard bearer and innovator, the reform agenda was predicated on an overhaul of governance, performance, systems and reporting practices in the sponsoring department and the state's public prison network. Insights from three credos of imprisonment, theorizations of 'hierarchical' and 'intelligent' governance and accountability, the interplay of values in changing practice, and the ways in which inspectors establish particular inspection regimes, frame analysis of reform implementation and the inspection regime in action over a ten year period. Using archival material, this research examines how the Inspectorate, in making things auditable, altered perceptions and organizational realities of a network of actors. It is contended that the governance and accountability tensions inherent in managerialism, exemplified in its reliance on 'neutral' accounting technologies to incentivise, manage and monitor custodial outcomes, privilege instrumental hierarchical governance and accountability regimes that ignore the rehabilitative aspects of imprisonment. Further, conflicting publicly espoused and privately held values play vital roles in moulding performance in a penal setting, and are fundamental to changing outcomes in networks. The Inspectorate's public values and intelligent accountability regime resonate with the Department's policy objectives and public values, but are shown to have been initially inconsistent with network actors' hidden private values. The research concludes that the appointment of an independent Inspectorate has facilitated the accountability of those responsible for prison quality and positively influenced the treatment of prisoners. A secondary concern is investigating conflicting propositions about the relative governance, performance and accountability of privately and publicly operated prisons. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Governance; Intelligent accountability; New public management; Penal reform; Performance; Privatization; Public sector; Values",,"English, L.M.; The University of Sydney School of Business, Australia; email: linda.english@sydney.edu.au",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Catchment-oriented accounting directs attention to the harm inflicted by unsustainable practices by integrating measurements of the multiple causes of degradation into meaningful accounts. We propose a semi-qualitative risk matrix to enhance stakeholder participation in the construction of these accounts: our matrix allows lay-stakeholders to use their lived experiences to socialise expert measurements, and thus embark on a journey of learning socially about sustainable living. An irrigation case-study is used to evaluate the extent to which irrigators displayed the following social learning capacities through their contribution to the construction of risk accounts on the impact of irrigation on their catchment: awareness of each other's competing-and-interdependent goals and perspectives, shared problem identification, appreciation of the complex issues at hand, motivation to work collaboratively, trust and the creation of formal-informal relationships. Four of seven irrigators displayed many of these capacities as they contested unsustainable values embedded in conventional irrigation discourse, and articulated less harmful priorities. The remaining irrigators took advantage of the analytical-deliberative spaces (provided by our matrix and accounts) to better appreciate the environmental impact of irrigation. © 2013 .","Emancipatory; Environmental; Social; Social learning; Sustainability",,"Saravanamuthu, K.; Newcastle Business School, Callaghan 2308, New South Wales, Australia; email: Kalathevi.Saravanamuthu@newcastle.edu.au",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

We argue that climate disclosure practices and regulation have provided an opportunity to reinforce the ideological landscape of neoliberalism. In order to anchor this argument, we show that the origins of carbon regulation have emerged almost exclusively from within non-elected coalitions of multinationals operating through private, not-for-profit entities. These organisations continue to shape community expectations and influence government of climate change abatement strategies. To explore the impact neoliberalism has had on the environment, we examine the Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB), its role, and its global impact on the regulation of reporting firms. © 2013 .","Accounting standards; Carbon disclosures; Climate change; Climate Disclosure Standards Board; Neoliberalism",,"Cortese, C.; School of Accounting and Finance, , NSW 2500, Australia; email: corinne@uow.edu.au",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

This paper seeks to dismiss such suggestions. For the accounting profession to be able to meaningfully contribute to extending accountability beyond investors, lenders, and creditors (and it undoubtedly serves these interests well) it will need to abandon many core accounting conventions and principles - something that is deemed unlikely to occur - at least in the readers' lifetime. This paper also highlights the apparent absurdity of using market-based mechanisms (such as cap-and-trade systems for pollutants) to solve social and environmental problems that were effectively caused by 'the market'. Having questioned the role of the accounting profession in contributing to broad-based corporate accountability, the paper concludes by questioning the role of accounting and business educators in instilling some form of personal social responsibility in the minds of students. © 2013 .","Environmental; Social; Sustainability",,"Deegan, C.; School of Accounting, , Melbourne, Australia; email: Craig.Deegan@rmit.edu.au",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

We argue that this condition is most obvious in the research audits conducted in Britain, and spreading globally, audits that record both the extreme externalization in business scholarship of all the sources of the wealth expropriated by business, and at the same time, regulate the very labour that produces this extreme self-regulation. Although this self-regulated labour regards itself as complete, and although it regards its acts of externalization as acts of self-making, we consider the relation between pedagogy and scholarship in order to show how this pervasive form of self-regarding simply does not hold. We conclude by noting that if business scholarship persists in defining itself against all that makes wealth possible, and thus making itself, logically at least, worthless, it also opens the possibility of starting an investigation of wealth, worth and value, from another point of view, one not dependant of completing business, but competing with it. © 2013.","Accountability; Audit; Critical; Neo-liberalism; Public sector",,"Dunne, S.; Centre for Philosophy and Political Economy, University Road, Leicester, LE1 7RH, United Kingdom; email: s.dunne@le.ac.uk",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Although scholars in many disciplines have actively contributed to migration research, accounting scholars have been less actively engaged, despite migration's use of concepts so closely aligned with accounting: costs, benefits, risk, and control. This paper considers how accounting researchers may contribute to the study of migration, highlighting the potential for critical researchers to re-define terrains of discourse.Migration theories are introduced, illustrating the complexities and interconnectedness of the role of globalisation, poverty, state functioning, and the social sciences. We integrate previous research of accounting, revealing the discipline as part of the language and neoliberal agenda imbued in migration issues, and its participation in co-creating precarious boundaries and myopic concepts defining the debates. We provide a case analysis, specifically illustrating accounting's calculative practices and rhetoric as limiting and obscuring social issues in migration, providing yet another instance of accounting's participation in social controversies.The rhetoric of accounting as merely a technique and the prevailing view of its objectivity are disputed as we reveal accounting's role in creating a simplifying reality, ignoring the complex interdependencies and powerful forces at play in migration arenas. Although much work is to be done in the accounting field to illuminate its role regarding migration issues, we are optimistic that critical researchers can provide expanded ways of thinking and a contribution to the deliberations. The work's originality is contained in its unique framing of migration discourse, revealing the skewed and shadowy assumptions of its traditional discourse, and examining how critical research expands possibilities for promoting social justice in the migration landscape. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Accountability Critical; Migration; Public Interest",,"Agyemang, G.; School of Management, , Egham TW20 0EX, United Kingdom; email: Gloria.Agyemang@rhul.ac.uk",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

We are also interested in how the content and structure of the report transforms over time, how the possible link to the internal management control agenda is made, and how it reshapes organizational routines. The paper applies a critical approach where mostly non-financial, intellectual capital-related measurement, management, and reporting processes and structures are being questioned and discussed from different perspectives.This study is based on a qualitative case study approach where a number of semi-structured interviews have been conducted in various Austrian universities at different management levels over a period of approximately one year. In addition, interviews have been held with other stakeholders of universities (e.g., representatives from the ministry) and with members of the working group dealing with the KBS at the supra-university level. An inductively oriented methodology was chosen to obtain a deeper understanding of the current (management) interpretation and use of the KBS, both externally and internally. This paper aims to investigate the practice of KBS in order to build new knowledge relating to both externally oriented reporting and internally oriented management control.The findings indicate that as a reporting-tool, the KBS is embedded in a broader framework of governance and accountability regarding public universities, and interlinks the following different reporting-formats: (1) the KBS itself, (2) the performance report, and (3) the financial statement of accounts. Rectors, deans, and management accountants have highlighted different parts of the framework as important and problematic. However, it is obvious that governing via externally oriented reports and rules of accountability also has relevance to internal management decision and control agendas.Furthermore, there is an on-going debate about measuring, benchmarking, and standardizing qualities within and between universities. Scientific professionals generally question the viability of only one standardized reporting format for scientific outcomes, while the administrative staff usually promotes the necessity of such a report - for example, with respect to benchmarking routines. By analysing the practices triggered by KBS reporting, we contribute to the discussion of how performance (measures and targets) can be represented, interpreted, and acted upon within public organizations in general and within public universities in particular. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Accountability; Governance; Intellectual capital; Management Control; Performance measurement; Public Sector",,"Habersam, M.; Stockholm University, , S-106 91 Stockholm, Sweden; email: michael.habersam@uibk.ac.at",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

It continues the search for capitalists in American history begun in 'Americanism and financial accounting theory. Part 1: Was America Born Capitalist?' Part 1 concluded that America was not 'born capitalist' in Marx's sense, and that the capitalist mentality had not appeared in farming even by the late 19th century, on southern slave plantations by the Civil War, or in manufacturing enterprises by the 1830s. This paper (Part 2) challenges Alfred Chandler's thesis that the 'modern business enterprise' brought 'a new type of capitalism' from around the mid-19th century. It re-examines accounting evidence from the Boston textile mills, the railroads, and the iron and steel industry. It concludes that the Boston Associates who historians often see as 'proto-capitalists', the 'managerial capitalists' Chandler sees on the railroads, and the 'entrepreneurial capitalists' he sees in the iron and steel industry and elsewhere, remained semi-capitalists because their capitals and workers were not 'free'. The paper re-examines the 'costing renaissance', the introduction and spread of product costing, standard costing, ROI and flexible budgets, and the evidence in Chandler's and Johnson and Kaplan's studies of the DuPont Powder Company and General Motors. This suggests that capitalism only appeared in America by around 1900, after more than two decades of intense conflict between 'capital and labour', and became established by the 1920s. This is the critical turning point in American business history, not the appearance of 'managerial capitalism', the paper argues. It concludes that America did not catch up with British capitalism until the late 1920s because its ruling elite faced an ideological problem created by its exceptional transition from a society of simple commodity producers and semi-capitalists, particularly the threat of popular socialism. The final paper, Part 3: 'Adam Smith, the rise and fall of socialism, and Irving Fisher's theory of accounting', argues that Fisher made a seminal contribution to solving this problem, but his legacy is a pathological theory of financial accounting. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Accounting history; Capitalism; Critical; Public interest; Social",,"Bryer, R.; Warwick Business School, , Coventry CV4 7 AL, United Kingdom; email: Rob.Bryer@wbs.ac.uk",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The study employs the concept of ideological strategies as developed by Eagleton (1991/2007) to analyze the ideologies underlying employee reporting. The analysis shows that corporate disclosure, though relatively developed in some areas, still paints a partial picture of people within companies. Employees are presented in a fairly narrow, mechanistic manner as efficiently aiming at a kind of development and growth of [only] instrumental value to companies, and not as complex, individual human beings possessing a variety of qualities and needs. The study reveals how corporate talk presents the relationship between companies and labor according to a unitarist perception. Particularly, the study shows how corporate talk works to naturalize and universalize this ideological claim and, hence, hide its contingent nature.

Nevertheless, firms' motivations for issuing standalone CSR Reports are not clear. In this paper, we consider two different explanations: signaling and greenwashing. The first explanation, signaling, proposes that firms use standalone CSR Reports as a signal of their superior commitment to CSR, which suggests firms with stronger social and environmental records will be more likely to issue standalone CSR Reports as compared to those without. The second explanation, greenwashing, proposes that firms use standalone CSR Reports to pose as "" good"" corporate citizens even when they do not have stronger social and environmental records. To provide insight into these explanations we compare the CSR performance scores of firms that issue CSR reports to those firms that do not. We control for firm size, leverage, profitability and industry. We find that firms that voluntarily issue standalone CSR Reports generally have higher CSR performance scores, which suggests that firms are using voluntary CSR Reports to publicize stronger social and environmental records to stakeholders. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Environmental; Social; Sustainability",,"Mahoney, L.S.; Eastern Michigan University, 425 Owen Hall, Ypsilanti, MI 48197, United States; email: lois.mahoney@emich.edu",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

It does so at a time when the discussion of methodological issues appears less important to many empirical accounting researchers than demonstrating a familiarity with the growing range of theoretical perspectives available to pursue such enquiries. The paper initially outlines Laughlin's original and revised frameworks, following which a number of the resultant attributions of specific schools of thought are questioned. The original categorisation exercise is concluded still to offer an insightful basis on which to compare and contrast empirical research approaches. For this reason, the same exercise is extended to locate three further, currently popular ways of seeing: institutional theory, actor network theory and practice theory. The focus then shifts to a more detailed exploration of the relationship that exists between Laughlin's idea of middle range thinking and Merton's characterisation of middle range theory and theorisation. Informed by the resultant insights, the middle range or substantive theory credentials of a range of schools of thought currently widely subscribed in interdisciplinary accounting research are then examined. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Methodology; Middle range theory; Schools of thought; Ways of seeing",,"Roslender, R.; School of Business, , Dundee, United Kingdom; email: r.roslender@dundee.ac.uk",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Laughlin's discussion also provides some rationale for why organizations may pursue particular pathways in response to environmental disturbances. Responding to his call to future researchers, the current paper builds upon Laughlin's work by drawing on Social Network Theory (SNT) as offering an explanation about how the dynamic processes implicit in his framework may operate in effecting change within organizations and as a consequence, why particular pathways may be adopted. While Laughlin's initial premise and consequent contentions are grounded largely in critical theory, in augmenting his framework with insights derived from SNT, this paper contends that the dynamic processes invoked in response to environmental disturbances are capable of being operationalized, generalized and tested.

The framework draws on Habermas' theory of communicative action, which is underpinned by a deliberative, consensus-oriented conceptualization of democracy. Based on recent developments in political theory and related applied fields, we argue that deliberative democracy is only one of several democratic bases useful in understanding and/or improving accounting and accountability systems to better meet the needs of diverse contemporary societies. In particular, we contend that, in relying on Habermasian-style deliberative democracy, Laughlin's conceptualizations do not fully account for the dimensions of disagreement and difference in democratic interactions. Drawing on the work of agonistic political theorists and studies from the applied fields of communicative planning and critical policy analysis, we argue that deliberative democracy approaches based on ideal speech criteria and universalistic consensus need to be balanced with theorizations that recognize the reality and value of more open-ended and unfinalizable struggles among actors with different histories, cultures, and/or ideological orientations. While cognizant of the challenges involved in bridging deliberative-agonistic conceptualizations of democracy, such endeavors provide opportunities for (re)theorizations that offer promise for enriching critical accounting by, as we argue, reinforcing the critical/political in critical accounting. To this end, we consider possibilities of forging links between Laughlin's work and our own proposals for dialogic/polylogic accountings based on agonistic democracy in an effort to foster more enabling accounting praxis. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Communicative action; Critical; Democracy; Habermas; Praxis; Public interest",,"Brown, J.; School of Accounting and Commercial Law, PO Box 600, Wellington, New Zealand; email: judy.brown@vuw.ac.nz",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Consensus building is often considered a central value for rational decision-making and management. However, more than a democratic confrontation of vantage points, the quest for consensus is a way to discourage conflict and resistance. Our main argument is that accounting and consensus play central roles in processes of definition and the social reproduction of dominant interests. Accounting acts to promote some stakes and strategies (and silence others), as if they were collective and disinterested, which makes them more powerful in debates that deny struggles and asymmetries in positions of power, as well as increases legitimacy by creating an illusion of participation. We illustrate these processes through a case study in which we document the intersection between two fields of knowledge, marketing and accounting, that compete for a monopoly on the definition of value and the ability to speak for the organisation. This analysis draws on Bourdieu's conceptualisation of symbolic domination to highlight how powerful actors secure influence while avoiding contestation. Accounting produces symbolic violence that consolidates asymmetries in positions of power by shaping what is consensual and what is not so that dominant interests are reproduced with the consent of those who have most to lose in the process. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Critical; Intellectual capital; Management control; Public interest; Symbolic domination",,"Morales, J.; ESCP Europe, 79 avenue de la République, 75543 Cedex 11, Paris, France; email: jmorales@escpeurope.eu",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The commentary concurs with the plea of Chabrak and Craig for curriculum and pedagogy reforms but notes the difficulties this faces in the UK (and possibly elsewhere) given the growing commercialisation of and competition between UK universities, and the influence of professional credentialing upon accounting academics who lack knowledge of accounting research. However, there is a public interest need, and a student and employer desire for curriculum and pedagogical reform and university teaching quality systems do not militate against this.

The submitted assignments attest to the originality and richness of non-conformist stories reported by some students. However, they also revealed strong instances of cognitive dissonance that we contend was fostered by the contradictions some students detected between the rhetoric and the reality of capitalism; and by the perpetuation of socially bereft capitalist values in accounting curricula. The assignment manifested student discontent with the current pervading economic system and its moral and ethical precepts. We identify the ways by which students responded to their cognitive dissonance. We propose some pedagogic and curriculum initiatives to improve accounting education.

Although the methodological limitations of positivist research, as well as the political and cultural foundations of its hegemony, have regularly been highlighted in the literature, the merits of interdisciplinarity are still denied by the major institutions dominating the field. The present paper argues that the case in favor of academic pluralism is nonetheless worth pursuing, because not only it represents a central feature of the interdisciplinary identity, but also because it provides support to those engaged in a relentless (and sometimes successful) bid for greater openness in accounting research. The paper's main goal is to promote and further this endeavor by moving the line of argument off the beaten track of methodology and domination in order to focus on morality. The largely unexplored terrain of morality can be used as a basis for original arguments supportive of intellectual pluralism that may help to raise awareness of alternative research avenues and possibilities - though it is important not to harbor unrealistic hopes. Drawing on Charles Taylors' view of modernity, we highlight the richer moral background from which the current stress in the discipline on individualistic values and instrumental reason took its rise. As a result, we provide the accounting mainstream with the perspective of an alternative framework for its research agenda by (re)adopting an ethic of compassion.

The findings indicate that significant differences exist on both single and aggregate mean levels among the participant groups. Internal auditors report a higher perceived importance of the red flags related to detecting misappropriation of assets than of those related to fraudulent financial reporting, whereas the opposite is true for economic crime investigators. For external auditors, only small differences in aggregate means between misappropriation of assets and fraudulent financial reporting were found. As the sensitivity to fraud type may affect professional planning, procedures and techniques with regard to fraud prevention, detection and investigation, the results may have both practical and theoretical implications.

Fundamental questions are being raised about how SEA should be defined, who should be doing the defining, and if, how and whom it should engage. We attempt to enrich these debates by drawing on the political philosophy of agonistic pluralism and a set of debates about engagement within the environmental movement - ""the death of environmentalism"" debates. We set forth the ""Death"" debates and, in doing so, contextualize and theorize the contested nature of SEA engagement using agonistic pluralism. In contrast to consensually oriented approaches to SEA, the desired outcome is not necessarily resolution of ideological differences but to imagine, develop, and support democratic processes wherein these differences can be recognized and engaged. We construe the ""Death"" debates as illustrative of the contestable practical and political issues facing both SEA and progressive social movements generally, demonstrating the range of deliberations necessary in contemplating effective engagement programs. The SEA community, and civil society groups, can benefit from the more overtly political perspective provided by agonistic pluralism. By surfacing and engaging with various antagonisms in this wider civic sphere, SEA can more effectively respond to, and move beyond, traditional politically conservative, managerialist discourses. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Agnostic pluralism; Critical; Environmental; Ethics; Praxis; Public interest; Social",,"Brown, J.; School of Accounting and Commercial Law, PO Box 600, Wellington, New Zealand; email: judy.brown@vuw.ac.nz",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The accounting evidence suggests that America began to make the transition to capitalism around 1900 in a period of intense conflict between 'capital and labour' generated by 'big business' from the 1880s, a process not completed until the 1920s. This paper (Part 3) examines the consequences for America's political ideology and financial accounting theory. America's exceptional transition, it argues, explains the history of its political ideology, and this history explains Irving Fisher's theory of accounting. Section A argues that America lagged behind Britain because it started from a society of simple commodity producers and semi-capitalists, which created an exceptional ideological problem for its ruling elite. Big business generated hostility from workers, farmers and small employers - expressed in labour movements, 'populism', socialism, and 'progressivism' - and created an ideological problem by contradicting the 'independent producer' ideology of workers and farmers, and the 'individual liberalism' of small manufacturers and merchants, both underwritten by Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations. The paper argues that Smith's theory of price articulates as semi-capitalist accounting, which explains his popularity in America until the appearance of big business in the 1880s. Socialism and progressivism became political forces in America from 1900 to around 1920. Progressivism produced 'corporate liberalism', the ideological counter to socialism that corporations could be made 'socially responsible' by government regulation and 'publicity' to ensure they earned only 'fair' returns, but this left two problems. First, socialists argued that no profit was 'fair', and second, fear of the 'labour danger' made American financial reports secretive and conservative. Section B argues that Irving Fisher responded to these problems with a theory of accounting, which he developed as a refutation of Marx and the American brand of socialism advocated by Eugene Debs, the threateningly successful presidential candidate of the Socialist Party of America. An important but neglected reason for socialism's abrupt collapse around 1920, it argues, was that the socialists lost the intellectual argument with the middle classes, and that Fisher's theory played an important role in this defeat. Fisher was a vigorous self-publicist, strongly influenced the teaching of economics and accounting in the universities and, the paper argues, changed the language of American accounting. Fisher claimed that accounting practice supported his theory of 'capital' and 'income', but the paper shows he did not understand double-entry bookkeeping or the accountants' 'cost theory of value', and therefore divorced accounting from the reality of business transactions. As his theory underlies the FASB's framework, the paper concludes that Fisher's legacy to the world is a pathological theory of financial accounting. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Accounting history; Capitalism; Critical; Public interest; Social",,"Bryer, R.; Warwick Business School, , Coventry CV4 7 AL, United Kingdom; email: rob.bryer@wbs.ac.uk",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

They explain Fisher's theory as the product of America's exceptional transition to capitalism and the ideological consequences. Part 1 uses Marx's theories of the transition in England, of colonisation, and of ideology, to construct an accounting history model of America's transition to capitalism that identifies the dominant social relations of production and calculative mentalities, and uses them to predict the accounting signatures and political ideologies we should observe if the theories are correct. Parts 1 and 2 test the model. Part 3 explores the ideological consequences of America's transition, for America and financial accounting. Scholars generally assume that America was 'born capitalist'; historians argue it became capitalist sometime from the late 18th to early 19th centuries. The model, however, identifies early farmers as 'simple commodity producers' who, it predicts, kept only single entry accounts of debt, and had a 'producer' ideology of 'equality' and 'freedom'. It identifies planters and manufacturers as 'semi-capitalists' - part merchant capitalist and part simple commodity producer - who it predicts calculated 'profit' as consumable surplus, pursued the 'simple rate of profit', controlled only prime costs, and had an ideology of 'individualism' that combined the producers' ideology with the merchants' 'laissez-faire'. Part 1 re-examines evidence from accounts to around the mid-19th century, which confirms that farmers were not capitalists and that even the most advanced merchants, manufacturers and planters were semi-capitalists. Part 2 searches for capitalists in the second half of the 19th century. It re-examines evidence from the accounts of the Boston Associates who historians have seen as 'proto-industrial capitalists'; from the railroads heralded by Chandler as the beginning of 'managerial capitalism'; and from 'entrepreneurial capitalists' like Andrew Carnegie who created the large corporations that conquered America from the 1880s. Their financial accounts and cost management systems reveal the same semi-capitalist mentality found in the early 19th century. Re-examination of the 'costing renaissance' in the 1890s and evidence from the DuPont Powder Company and General Motors from 1900 to 1920, suggests that only from around 1900, after escalating conflict between 'capital and labour', did the capitalist mentality appear in new management accounting systems focused on 'return on investment'. Part 3 shows that the accounting evidence closely correlates with the history of American political ideology. It argues that Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations dominated American politics until the late 19th century because it theorised a nation of simple commodity producers and semi-capitalists. It explains the delay in America's transition compared to Britain's, and the decline in the popularity of laissez-faire from the 1880s, as consequences of this exceptional starting point. 'Big business' capitalism created an ideological problem for America's ruling elite, particularly the threat of socialism from around 1900 to 1920. Part 3 argues that Fisher's neoclassical theory of 'capital' and 'income', designed as a critique of Marx, responded to this problem and played an important role in undermining middle class support for socialism.

We found that SPMS enhanced the interaction among managers and between managers and residents and provided residents with opportunities to participate in local authority decision-making. Market forms of management however, promoted individualism and the pursuit of narrow departmental goals. There was increased control by managers and greater reliance on experts which diminished local people's participation (and the role of councillors) in local affairs. The pairing of contradictory discourses based on efficiency, markets and participatory democracy promoted an overly rational form of democracy inimical to a deliberative democracy. The relations between staff were in a state of continuous tension.

Driven by pressures for more accounting and accountability, its characteristics have variously been described as being in tension with the traditional collegial and autonomous management culture, threatening its demise. This study applies a multi-theoretical lens to recognize the interests of academics as important stakeholders and critically analyses the existing literature to determine the current status of both cultures within Australian public universities. A series of interviews with a number of vice chancellors and other senior management staff complement and provide a management perspective to the analysis. The results suggest that amidst a shift toward a corporate culture, aspects of collegial and autonomous practices continue to exist in various degrees among universities due to different levels of influencing forces on its operating environment. A quasi-management approach exists with continued tensions between both cultures, compromising their expected outcomes. Universities are attempting to narrow this tension gap. An analysis of the quasi-management approach further reveals that a right balance between both cultures has potential to serve as an effective management model under a multi-theoretical platform.

The paper addresses recent and ongoing calls for more studies of public sector auditing in action to deepen our understanding of the responses or manoeuvring of auditors and auditees during the process of performance auditing. A key contribution of the paper is confirmation that performance auditing continues to be a contested activity and its credibility in practice remains uncertain.

Household accounting in Japan provides an excellent research site to understand the nature of feminine accounting practices. The social significance of the Japanese household and the country's cultural emphasis on interdependence mean that accounting has a different meaning in the life of Japanese women, compared to what has been identified in Anglo-Saxon-based studies. The study finds that their accounting practice is characterized by the integration of masculine and feminine qualities, as illustrated by Dillard and Reynolds (2008), and is more enabling in nature. Women use 'hard', objective accounting figures both to foster the long-term development of the family and to contribute to Japanese society. Accounting has been a vehicle for women to express their motherhood and construct their identity as women. The distinctive nature of Japanese women's accounting practice and the role this practice plays in facilitating feminine values highlight how important it is to further investigate feminine accounting practice in different social and cultural contexts in order to develop gender research in accounting. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Critical; Feminine accounting practice; Gender; Household; Japan",,"Komori, N.; Sheffield University Management School, 9 Mappin Street, Sheffield S1 4DT, United Kingdom; email: N.Komori@sheffield.ac.uk",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Through an eclectic use of ANT, neo-institutionalism and political economy, it demonstrates that accounting remains decoupled from operational processes because of the particular manner in which accounting is constructed and enabled; the ostensive characteristics of accounting objects around which performativity of accounting is defined; and the organisational context, which involves certain 'political imperfections' that cannot be narrated within organisational apparatus of modernity. Accounting, being an apparatus of modernity, finds it difficult to codify such 'imperfections' and to offer an operational doctrine to govern the real business processes that are embedded within these 'imperfections'. Hence, it remains decoupled from core operational activities but performs an important role of insulating 'political imperfections' with which business operates. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Accounting change; Critical; ERP/SAP; Management control; Praxis",,"Alawattage, C.; University of Aberdeen Business School, , Scotland, United Kingdom; email: c.g.alawattage@abdn.ac.uk",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The strategy I follow runs at two levels of abstraction.First, I examine a concrete example of interdisciplinary research in taxation. More precisely, I examine Hikaka and Prebble's (2010) recent paper where, applying Luhmannian autopoietic theory to tax law, they make a series of claims about the productivity of their research strategy as well as the consistency and coherence of Luhmann's interdisciplinary framework. Whereas my analytical and conceptual critique of Hikaka and Prebble's paper stands on its own, it should also be read as revealing the obstacles that lurk behind interdisciplinary research in using such a complex and idiosyncratic theory as Luhmann's autopoietic account of law and society. Accordingly, my analysis shows how autopoietic theory can indeed prove useful for tax and accounting reform as well as to connect tax theory and notions of public interest.Second, I extrapolate from the analysis of Hikaka and Prebble's paper some general problems that current interdisciplinary tax research needs to give further consideration: (i) how to identify productive research questions and uses of interdisciplinary resources; (ii) the dubious added value of interdisciplinary research, given its tendency to adopt complex theoretical apparatuses in a cursory way with little comparison being made to existing research achievements; and (iii) the risk of using interdisciplinary research as an exercise of confirmatory investigation and/or an exercise of mere translation of one discipline's problems into another discipline's language. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Autopoiesis; Critical; Public sector; Research methods; Tax",,"Vilaça, G.V.; School of Political Science and International Studies, , St Lucia, QLD 4072, Australia; email: guilherme.vasconcelos@eui.eu",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

We examine simulacra as they have been applied in two interconnected fair value accounting arenas. Firstly, simulacra employed as a measurement basis for certain financial instruments. In this regard, we challenge the FASB's insistence that fair value accounting is an originary market based measurement system. Secondly, we examine the process of simulation as employed by the FASB in copying and amending FAS 157 in its subsequent modifications to the guidance provided to the preparers of financial statements. Our purpose here is to both reinforce the absence of a market reality and also to illustrate how the FASB's subsequent modifications to FAS 157 were shaped by political forces.

Drawing on 23 semi-structured interviews with both male and female accountants, the specificities of these approved paths, alongside the construction of alternative, feminized routes, lacking the legitimacy of the former and often implying a derailment of women's careers from a very early stage, will be explored.

Finally, we consider three possible processes that may explain Holland and colleagues' conjoining of accountants with bookkeepers.

Similarly, the potential for the underlying technology to be applied in ways to encourage new forms of accountability appears to be forfeited in the interests of enrolling company filers.We theorise the activities of the SEC and in particular its chairman at the time, Christopher Cox, over a three year period, both prior to and following the 'credit crisis'. We argue that individuals and institutions play a central role in advancing the socio-technical project that is constituted by interactive data. We adopt insights from ANT (Callon, 1986; Latour, 1987, 2005b) and governmentality (Miller, 2008; Miller and Rose, 2008) to show how regulators and the proponents of the technology have acted as spokespersons for the interactive data technology and the retail investor. We examine the way in which calculative accountability has been privileged in the SEC's construction of the retail investor as concerned with atomised, quantitative data (Kamuf, 2007; Roberts, 2009; Tsoukas, 1997).

Where once accountability was exercised through the ballot box, now in the neoliberal age managerial and market based forms of accountability predominate. The analysis identifies resistance from civil society campaigns to the neoliberal restructuring of public services which leads to public accountability (PA) becoming a contested arena. To develop this analysis a re-theorisation of PA, as a relationship where civil society seeks to control the state, is explored in the context of social housing in England over the past thirty years. Central to this analysis is a dialogical analysis of key documents from a social housing regulator and civil society campaign. The analysis shows that the current PA practices are an outcome of both reforms from the government and resistance from civil society (in the shape of tenants' campaigns). The outcome of which is to tell the story of the changes in PA (and accountability) centring on an analysis of discourse. Thus, the paper moves towards answering the question - what has happened to PA during the neoliberal age?. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Critical realism; Dialogics; Neoliberalism; Public accountability; Social housing; Social movements",,"Smyth, S.; Accounting group, Riddel Hall, 185 Stranmillis Road, Belfast, BT9 5EE, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom; email: s.j.smyth@qub.ac.uk",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

My reflective personal account, an autoethnography, explores difference in approaches to and insights into accountability in practice. The changed understandings of accountability developed during and after the production of two sets of social accounts with a not-for-profit organization. As part of the sense making process within the personal account, generative metaphor is used to enable reflection on the problem of accountability within social accounts. In this case the problem is both acknowledging and recognising the effect of my approach to and understandings of accountability during the production and reporting of two social accounts. The first social account was developed with a more formal and instrumental approach to accountability than the second which drew upon the initial experience and understanding of the first included a broader and more complex view of accountability. The recognition of a changed appreciation of accountability through the experience provides a deeper view of how accountability can be played out in practice with a not-for-profit community based organization. The result is my acknowledgement of a broader more encompassing notion of the complexity of accountability as part of a fragmented and changing world (Miller, 2002). By acknowledging this complexity I have opened a space that enables me to recognise the influence of my approach to accountability in practice. There is a need to recognise how we approach accountability in order to counter the current dominance of calculative forms of accountability from the 'business case' perspective supporting control of powerful elites that steer society. An accountability that includes complexity and the non-calculative is a more appropriate form for a not-for-profit organization rather than a dominant calculative accountability. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Accountability; Autoethnography; Metaphor; Not-for-profit; Social account",,"Gibbon, J.; Newcastle University Business School, , Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 7RU, United Kingdom; email: jane.gibbon@newcastle.ac.uk",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

To answer this question, this research considers the problematics of accountability found in the limits inherent to the giving of an account (Messner, 2009), in the ambiguous relationship between accountability and transparency (Roberts, 2009), and in the as yet unresolved contradictions of accountability (McKernan, 2012). Accounterability is seen as a practice of resisting accountability demands while giving an account. Alternative practices arising out of such resistance are inductively identified through an ethnographic study of the day-to-day practices of the Salvation Army used as an extreme case. This case shows how an ideal form of accountability raises more questions than it answers in practice, thereby leading individuals to develop their own counter-abilities. Because accountability to a Higher-Stakeholder appears to be an unreachable ideal, identifying to whom one should give an account of oneself becomes problematic. A working response to the problematics of accountability, accounterability emerges as the mechanism whereby the limits and contradictions of account giving are transformed into the conditions of its realisation: unreachable accountability is transformed into tangible day-to-day practices that may differ slightly from expected ideal conduct. It transpires from this study that the main strength of accountability lies in its ability to absorb and to override its limits and contradictions, transforming them into conditions of its possibility. As such, accounterability emerges as the ultimate manifestation of this strength. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Accountability; Accounterability; Reflexivity; Resistance; Responsibility; The Salvation Army",,"Joannides, V.; Grenoble Ecole de Management, 12 rue Pierre Sémard, 38000 Grenoble, France; email: Vassili.Joannides@grenoble-em.com",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

It applies Derrida's work on responsibility, testimony, and gift to the problematic of accountability. Accountability's entanglement in the tension between, morality and ethics, singular and general responsibilities is examined, and Derrida's analysis of the aporia of responsibility is expressed and explored in terms of an aporia of accountability: It is argued that accountability relies on responsibility but that the rendering of accountability tends to undermine responsibility. In seeking to make a positive contribution to the question of how accountability might contribute to raising levels of responsibility for the other, the wholly other, the paper critically builds on existing Levinasian perspectives on this question, and develops the suggestion, inspired by Derrida's work, that in appropriate circumstances the reconfiguring of accountability as testimony and as gift might help enhance responsibility. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Accountability; Aporia; Ethics; Gift; Morality; Responsibility; Testimony",,"McKernan, J.F.; University of Glasgow Business School, West Quadrangle, Main Building, University Avenue, Glasgow, G12 8QQ, United Kingdom; email: john.mckernan@glasgow.ac.uk",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

This paper focuses on the role of the ROSCOs in the rail industry and their financial performance, critically examining the available literature and in particular the use that has been made of Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) to analyse the relations between ROSCOs and train operators, as well measuring their profitability from financial statements. The ROSCOs have been able to charge excessively high lease rentals to the train operating companies (TOCs). Analysis based on TCE which argues that ROSCOs have taken on serious risk to justify these returns (of default by a TOC, or of holding rolling stock surplus to requirements) has been misplaced, failing to see the dysfunctional nature of the market and the implicit government guarantee to maintain services.

This paper explores the behavioural and jurisdictional consequences of the normative drift towards fair value. Being informed by Giddens' work on late modernity, trust and expertise and drawing on a series of interviews with Canadian professional accountants, we argue that fair value accounting makes it increasingly harder for auditors to feel and actually be in control of their own expertise. That is, auditors' system of expertise is now considerably more reliant on a ""secondary"" - but perhaps in actual fact primary - layer of expertise revolving around market valuation techniques and principles. In so doing, the auditors' job is increasingly transformed as the involvement of valuators now represents a recurrent and pervasive phenomenon in audit processes. The auditor's role nowadays resembles that of an arbiter having to mediate discrepancies over subjective values - a number of which being produced by highly specialized valuators. Important implications ensue from a system of expertise in which the experts' degree of control over their own jurisdictional work is increasingly eroding. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Accounting standards; Expertise; Fair value accounting; Giddens; Jurisdictional work; Valuation",,"Gendron, Y.; Faculté des Sciences de l'administration, 2325, rue de la Terrasse, Local 6224, Québec City, QC G1V 0A6, Canada; email: yves.gendron@fsa.ulaval.ca",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The commentary will seek to explore these differences by reverting to a broader social science literature. The commentary will argue for recognising the complementarity of different research approaches - recognising difference and but recognising the strengths of both; bringing their understandings together when it helps to do so, but not seeking to combine them and ignore their difference roots; not seeking to privilege any approach over any other apart from recognising that different questions need different approaches to answer them.

We link human rights to notions of accountability and transparency (and hence to accounting) and elaborate how theoretical debates and developments in the humanities and social sciences refine but do not displace the argument that governance for human rights is a meaningful pursuit and policy. Indeed, they in some ways promote the mobilisation of accounting in the context. We go on to elaborate further how accounting (we especially focus upon corporate accounting and reporting) may come to the service of human rights.

In an attempt to begin to explore the extent to which, if any, the language of human rights has entered the discourse of corporate accountability, this paper investigates the adoption of the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) human rights standards by major multinational garment retail companies that source products from developing countries, as disclosed through their reporting media. The paper has three objectives. Firstly, to empirically explore the extent to which a group of multinational garment retailers invoke the language of human rights when disclosing their corporate responsibilities. The paper reviews corporate reporting media including social responsibility codes of conduct, annual reports and stand-alone social responsibility reports released by 18 major global clothing and retail companies during a period from 1990 to 2007. We find that the number of companies adopting and disclosing on the ILO's workplace human rights standards has significantly increased since 1998 - the year in which the ILO's standards were endorsed and accepted by the global community (ILO, 1998). Secondly, drawing on a combination of Responsive Regulation theory and neo-institutional theory, we tentatively seek to understand the regulatory space that may have influenced these large corporations to adopt the language of human rights obligations. In particular, we study the role that International Governmental Organisation's (IGO) such as ILO may have played in these disclosures. Finally, we provide some critical reflections on the power and potential within the corporate adoption of the language of human rights. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Human rights; Institutional theory; International Governmental Organisation; International Labour Organisation; Multinational companies; Responsive regulation",,"Islam, M.A.; School of Accounting, Economics and Finance, , Burwood, VIC 3125, Australia; email: azizul.islam@deakin.edu.au",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

It sets out a case for developing a new form of account of health and safety in any organisational setting. It draws upon the theoretical insights of Pierre Bourdieu taking inspiration from his assertion that in order to understand the "" logic"" of the worlds we live in we need to immerse ourselves into the particularity of an empirical reality. In this case the paper, analyses a preventable industrial disaster which occurred in Glasgow, Scotland which killed nine people. 11Among the dead were Tracey McErlane, 27, a receptionist from Possilpark, Glasgow, who left behind a seven-month-old son, Ryan; Ann Trench, 34, a computer operator from Colston, who was to due to end 15 years of service with ICL with her last shift; Margaret Brownlie, 49, from Strathaven; Peter Ferguson, 52, from Renfrewshire; Annette Rosina Doyle 24, of Crowhill St., Glasgow; Thomas McAulay, 41, from Glasgow; Kenneth Murray, 45; Timothy Smith, 31; and the chief executive of the company, Stewart McColl, 60, whose daughter, Sheena, had her leg amputated after she was crushed by falling masonry. and injured 33 others. The paper unearths the underlying structures of symbolic violence of the UK State, the Health and Safety Executive and capital with respect to health and safety at work in the case. While dealing with one specific country (Scotland) and arguably an anomalous event we contend that Bourdieu's objective of constructing a special case of what is possible can equally be used to question health and safety regimes and other forms of symbolic violence across the globe.Bourdieu (1998, p. 2) "" My entire scientific enterprise is indeed based upon the belief that the deepest logic of the social world can be grasped only if one plunges into the particularity of an empirical reality, historically located and dated, but with the objective of constructing it as a "" special case of what is possible,"" as Bachelard puts it, that is, as an exemplary case in a finite world of possible configurations. © 2011.",,,"Cooper, C.; University of StrathclydeUnited Kingdom; email: c.cooper@strath.ac.uk",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

This has further enhanced the power of transnational corporations. Developing countries are increasingly expected to secure foreign investment to stimulate their economies and lift the local population out of poverty. However, foreign investment also has implications for protection and enjoyment of human rights. Transnational corporations manage their risks by imposing stabilization clauses on host countries that constrain their ability to protect and enhance human rights. Conventional accounting and corporate social responsibility reports seem to be unable to respond to the emerging agenda on human rights. This paper seeks to stimulate debates about the protection and enjoyment of human rights by drawing attention to the way corporations constrain governments and people through clauses in investment agreements.

It presents evidence that Funnel's critique involves misreading and factual error. Crucially, the 2008 paper focuses on the role of the Auditor of State of Ohio; Funnell criticizes the piece as conflating the role of auditor and politician, as he puts it, policy matters "" are the democratic right of the elected government to determine not an unelected public servant."" This is in conflict with the institutional detail of the case: as is stated at various points in the paper, the Auditor of State of Ohio is directly elected in partisan political elections, one of the many such state auditor positions in the United States that follow this practice. The office holder during the time in question, James Petro, was a Republican politician elected Ohio's Auditor of State in 1994.This paper goes on to argue that, notwithstanding these matters, it is naïve to argue that auditors are essentially divorced from the world of politics and policy. Instead, auditors work within discursive frameworks of what is possible in ways that are more nuanced and practical. The paper reviews key elements in a stream of related work that draws on history and fieldwork to support this view.

Drawing upon the work of Taussig, he argues that while public sector auditors may know the truth, as may others, they choose not always to tell the truth in their reports and instead to treat what may be publicly unpalatable as a public secret. They modify their findings to ensure that these will be more acceptable to governments and, thereby, enhance their opportunity to influence government. These claims are shown in this paper to overstate the public sector auditor's response to difficult issues. Rather than keeping secrets, the contents of the auditor's reports may instead reflect the constitutional and institutional limitations in which they must work. Most importantly in most jurisdictions they are not to comment on matters of policy which are the domain of the government. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Performance auditing; Public secrets; Public sector auditors",,"Funnell, W.; School of Accounting and Finance, , NSW, Australia; email: warwick@uow.edu.au",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The paper begins with a brief explanation of deconstruction and implications of responsible deconstruction for truth in accounting. It is argued that Derrida's philosophy is compatible with a pragmatic approach to the pursuit of truth in accounting. In the second section of the paper the responsible, and essentially ethical, nature of deconstruction is discussed and the charge that it threatens to undermine institutions like accounting that rely of notions of truth, reasons, objectivity and disinterestedness, is rebuffed. In the third part of the paper responsibilities of the university as an institution, and accounting, are discussed drawing on some of Derrida's work on that theme, and in particular responsibility to and for reason. Derrida's analysis is applied to accounting and two competing orders of responsibility are identified and contrasted: a traditional responsibility grounded in representationalism and a new responsibility of openness to the other's demand. In the fourth part of the paper discussion of contrast and tension between types of responsibility is extended into a consideration of the relationship between moral and ethical responsibilities, in the context of accounting education. The paper concludes with reflections on the responsibilities of accounting educators. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Accounting Academics; Deconstruction; Ethics; Morality; Reason; Responsibility; Truth",,"McKernan, J.F.; The Business School, West Quadrangle, Main Building, Glasgow, Scotland, G12 8QQ, United Kingdom; email: john.mckernan@glasgow.ac.uk",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

It proposes to do so by suggesting extensions to both literatures. Arising from prescriptive concerns to recommend effective managerial approaches to the budgetary process, the general tendency in the literature of behavioural accounting has been to treat the matter of target-setting and the manner of acting on budgetary reports as independent variables, both of which are taken to influence performance as the dependent variable. Reasonable in its own terms, the unintended consequence has been a neglect of the capacity of budgetary controls to highlight variations in the cost-effectiveness with which individuals perform their work and so present opportunities for managerial bullying.The literature on workplace bullying (aka incivility, aggression, social undermining or mobbing) has been similarly inflected by its prescriptive origins. The need to enlist allies in the fight against workplace bullying has led to its depiction as a de-contextualised pathology, rather than a tendency to which managers are particularly prone. Similarly the need to detach bullying from the 'normal' pressures of management-by-exception has led to definitions which incorporate notions of individual victimisation and of its repetition over long periods of time.Using case material on a medium-sized shoe and slipper factory dating from 1978, this paper suggests that a comprehensive approach to workplace bullying needs to challenge these definitions. In particular it is important to recognise that there may be a collective dimension to bullying in the sense that an entire workforce can become its subject. In this scenario, sporadic and single-incident acts of aggression which fall outside the orthodox definitions of bullying have the effect of building up a kind of 'fear capital' (c.f. Bourdieu, 1984) such that the mere presence of the manager concerned, or even the prospect of that presence is accompanied by all the signs of psychological distress associated with more persistent forms of bullying.The paper further suggests that budgetary targets and information offer a highly effective means of achieving and maintaining the psychological ascendancy of the bullying manager over the bullied workforce: this because of their apparent mechanical connection with the employer's interest in the employment relationship. In the case study company that interest translated into the question of survival in the face of imports from the 'Third Italy' and from South East Asia, thereby lending force to the practice of budget-based bullying. In this last respect, the increasingly globalized product markets which have characterised the last three decades have rendered the thirty-year old fieldwork on which the paper is based only too relevant. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Accounting; Budgetary control; Bullying; Ethnography; Global competition",,"Armstrong, P.; The School of Management, , Leicester LE1 7RH, United Kingdom; email: p.armstrong@le.ac.uk",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

In particular this paper concentrates upon the lack of disclosure on three particular eco-justice issues: child labour, equal opportunities and poverty alleviation. We examine why this is the case and thereby illuminate underlying motives behind corporate unwillingness to address these issues. For this purpose, 23 semi-structured interviews were undertaken with senior corporate managers in Bangladesh. The findings suggest that the main reasons for non-disclosure include lack of resources, the profit imperative, lack of legal requirements, lack of knowledge/awareness, poor performance and the fear of bad publicity. Given these findings the paper raises some serious concerns as to why corporations would ever be expected to voluntarily report on eco-justice issues where performance is poor and negative publicity would be generated and profit impaired. Further research is still required to uncover current injustices and to imagine what changes can be made. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Absence; Bangladesh; CSR reporting; Eco-justice issues",,"Belal, A.R.; Finance, Accounting and Law Group, , Birmingham B4 7 ET, United Kingdom; email: a.r.belal@aston.ac.uk",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Regaining control over accounting standard setting was seen as imperative.

Our findings show that a re-balancing of power in favor of political interests has occurred between the stakeholders of international accounting standard setting.

The analysis, informed by framing theory, reveals that the efficiency of accounting is conditioned by people's calculative understanding.

More specifically, while we fully sympathize with K&R's overall conclusion that a duality perspective (as opposed to dualism) has the best potential to address the intriguing paradox of embedded agency, we also argue that some of their writings open up for multiple interpretations, of which some may be problematic if we want to dissolve the separation of agency and structure. As a reaction to this, we propose a number of specifications resulting in a duality perspective which is grounded in a 'flat and local' ontology. This perspective, in turn, forms the basis for the development of a general framework which identifies four principal origins of embedded agency, of which K&R mainly discuss one.

While taking issue with some of both Molisa (2011) and Tolle's (1997, 2005) arguments, I contend that their conclusions have some interesting implications. The religious traditions referenced by Tolle (1997, 2005) recognise a distinction between positive and negative theology. In effect our notions of what is real (and what is God) get in our way of understanding 'what is'. A similar theme can be found in the 'Transactional Analysis' school of psychology and in the sociology of Pierre Bourdieu. Bourdieu argues that institutions or fields (in his terminology) reflect the interests and values of the powerful and elite. Passive acceptance of these structures leads to repressive processes of symbolic violence. Emancipation requires both recognition of the taken-for-granted nature of values (habitus) and a willingness to change external structures and institutions (fields). In concluding, I argue that internal value change and external institutional change cannot be separated in a process of emancipation.

This commentary critically engages with Molisa's attempts to spiritualise the critical accounting project. Firstly, the paper positions his arguments specifically within the broader context of theological perspectives emerging within critical and interdisciplinary accounting research. It is argued that Pala's perspective both helps constitute a field of religious accounting enquiry and also shifts that field in a new direction. Secondly, the paper critically appraises Molisa's methodological engagement with the religious traditions and texts that form the basis of his arguments and the subsequent revelation of love as a key criterion for a spiritual and emancipatory accounting practice. The third section of the paper draws on this critical commentary to introduce an emergent theological and philosophical movement known as Radical Orthodoxy in an attempt to provoke further debate and discussion on the limited kinds of spiritual and religious perspectives that have thus far characterised this emergent field. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,,"McPhail, K.; La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia; email: K.McPhail@latrobe.edu.au",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

I argue that critical and social accounting scholars will need to undertake more explicit engagements with the spiritual dimensions of social change if we are ever to fully realize the emancipatory potential of the critical and social accounting projects. This paper explores some of the implications that spirituality might have for re-thinking how we've approached social change in our critical and social accounting literatures.One of the major insights that comes out of this paper is that emancipatory accounting research and practice may be falling short of not only effectively addressing the social injustices and environmental crises that it is concerned about but also of realizing of the full emancipatory potentialities of accounting practice because it has neglected, in various ways, to make spiritual realization the heart of its practice. These limitations come through, for instance, in how extant emancipatory accounting research and practice does not make enlightenment (the realization of the egoless state) the basis of its engagements and interventions, how it tends to privilege external transformation over inner change, the way it gives a lot of visibility to past processes and future goals while neglecting the eternal Now, and how "" love"" - one of the greatest values humanity has come up with - is almost completely absent in its discourse.What this might point to, in light of all this, is that there may be a need for new forms of accounting and accountability practice - what I call, awakening accounts and awakened accounting that are based on the realization of enlightenment and on "" awakened doing"" - that can go beyond these limitations and that can help to realize a "" new heaven"" and "" new earth"" ; that can help to realize heaven on earth. These new kinds of accounting and accountability practices involve an ontology, epistemology, axiology and practice that are very different to much of those that have historically informed accounting discourse since they are grounded on the premise that not only is all suffering, violence, conflict and dysfunction able to be transcended and that we are meant to live in sacred joy, love, beauty, creativity, truth, and inner peace since that is what we are in essence because we can do so by realizing unity with that dimension of life which is eternal, indestructible, infinite and unconditioned; which is the power, the intelligence, the One Life at the heart of life - and that means also our life; the life that we are. These accounts are, in other words or symbolically speaking, based on realizing atonement (at-one-ment) with God, the realization of Edenic bliss, a world of peace and love, the bringing of heaven to earth.This paper was written from a belief nourished by my own experience that, though we might forget it, we are in essence light and love and that therefore we ought to be making awakening our overriding aim, the centre of our strategies of social change, and love, its consequence, the very heart of our discourse. It is the greatest value that humanity has come up with, that expresses who we are in essence, who we are at our very best. It is hoped that this paper contributes in some small way then to bringing light and love more explicitly into our academic ethical discourse. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Accounting; Awakening; Emancipation; Enlightenment; Spirituality",,"Molisa, P.; School of Accounting and Commercial Law, , Wellington, New Zealand; email: Pala.Molisa@vuw.ac.nz",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

Hence, once decline set in, serious efforts were made to protect it from foreign competition. The DJI was highly fragmented, with some firms happy to comply and others in a state of defiance. The role of accounting helped to provide legitimacy and attract compliance, while the isomorphic forces (normative, coercive and mimicry) played key roles individually and together in binding together a set of voluntary price agreements. Key influencers in the DJI exerted agency to reinforce these efforts. These agreements proved more successful than other 'shelter' strategy schemes in other UK sectors in decline, e.g., cotton, in buying time for firms to diversify. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Accounting; Collective strategy; Dundee jute industry; Industrial decline; Institutional theory",,"Masrani, S.; School of Management, , Stirling, FK9 4LA, United Kingdom; email: sm135@stir.ac.uk",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

This paper analyses the attempts of various accounting technologies to respond to the emergence of immaterial labour through the lens of autonomist Marxism. Management and financial accounting are represented as impoverished attempts to measure the immaterial. The shortcomings of these traditional accounting technologies have been recognised by promoters of intellectual capital accounting, which attempts to account for the immaterial. From an autonomist Marxist perspective, intellectual capital accounting is perceived as an unsettling attempt to colonise 'biens communs' and the General Intellect. However, in the midst of these attempts to rationalise hitherto untapped areas of subjectivity and social life we find cause to cautiously celebrate immaterial labour whose complexity tends to elude measurement, thereby offering hope for socialisations which exceed capitalist control. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Accounting and reality; General Intellect; Intellectual capital; Labour process",,"Spence, C.; John Molson School of Business, 1455 Boul de Maisonneuve, Montreal, QC H3G 1M8, Canada; email: cspence@jmsb.concorida.ca",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

However, quantified and narrowly focused approaches such as Gray's (1988) and various extensions of Gray's framework of accounting values have largely dominated and strongly influenced cross-cultural accounting research and education without a critical evaluation of their theoretical and methodological limitations. Indeed, a significant number of studies, curricula and textbooks in international accounting have uncritically adopted Gray's exploratory framework. As such, the objective of this paper is to show the limitations of Gray's proposed hypotheses and the issues associated with the framework's largely uncritical adoption in international accounting literature. We provide evidence that Gray's framework gained authority and prominence in international accounting research largely because of subsequent researchers' unquestioning acceptance and application of this methodology. Importantly, we propose that international accounting research may be further enhanced by taking into account contextual factors such as political, legal, social and historical environments of countries. Using Germany as a case study, we apply this more holistic approach to provide additional insights into the factors differentiating German accounting from other accounting models. We recommend that accounting research will be enhanced by a critical examination of contextual environments of countries rather than a focus on measurement, quantification, simplification and categorisation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Accounting subculture; Culture; Germany; Hofstede-Gray theory; International accounting",,"Heidhues, E.; Department of Accounting and Finance, , NSW 2109, Australia; email: eva.heidhues@efs.mq.edu.au",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

This has a significant detrimental effect on the provision of infrastructures, public services and public utilities. Multinational companies (MNCs) in the oil, gas, and manufacturing sectors have used various tax schemes, ranging from off-shore intermediary companies to claiming recharges, royalties or technical fees and under-reporting of profit, to avoid paying tax in Nigeria. This paper locates the role of MNC tax practice within the broader dynamics of globalisation and the pursuit of profits, to argue that the drive of MNCs for higher profits can enrich our understanding of why some MNCs engage in tax evasion and avoidance at almost any cost. Stimulated by profitability, and intense competition and pressure to increase earnings, capitalist enterprises constantly seek new ways of boosting their earnings by developing complex structures and novel ways of increasing their profits by exploiting ambiguities in the law. The evidence shows that tax havens and offshore financial centres, shaped by globalisation, are major structures facilitating the anti-social tax practices of MNCs. The findings also suggest that the local business elite and local professionals are key actors in facilitating these anti-social tax practices in Nigeria for their own financial gain. These MNC practices also shift the tax burden to less mobile capital and less well-off citizens, and thereby undermine the Nigerian social fabric. This paper therefore argues that tax reforms are needed to reduce the problems created by MNCs and their affiliates operating in Nigeria. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Globalisation; Multinational companies; Offshore financial centres; Professionals; Pursuit of profits; Tax avoidance; Tax evasion; Tax havens",,"Otusanya, O.J.; Department of Accounting, Akoka, Yaba, P.O.

The case represents alternative accrual accounting solutions and thought. Earlier studies have discussed the (hyper) reality of accrual representations. This study contributes by examining why and in what form alternative accounting thought emerges, and what this means for accounting theory. The discussion stands out from prior studies by relying on autopoiesis as a frame of reference and centering on public sector as the empirical basis of inquiry. This enables a new way of understanding alternative accounting thought, founded on interrelated and complex organizational structures with blurred boundaries and potentially multiple identities. Such a form of autopoietic accounting is argued to represent something new, while still maintaining and representing old structures and identities. This paper illustrates e.g. how the debits represent something new and interrelations with other accounting environments, whereas the way of accounting for credits helps to preserve internal authority, capital and organizational structures.

Specifically, we study how regulatory prescriptions and best-practice discourse promoting a strengthening of audit committees' work, in the aftermath of the 2001-2002 financial scandals, were received by audit committee members. Is reception characterized with a logic of compliance and/or one of resistance? Conceptually, our study is informed by the notion of trials of strength, in that prescriptions are submitted to a series of loosely connected and quite informal tests taking place within the audit committee community. Our investigative task is predicated on in-depth interviews with audit committee members of Canadian public companies. The analysis indicates that the interviews are mainly reflective of a logic of resistance, which is especially sustained through interpretive strategies ultimately attributing the collapses of Enron and Arthur Andersen to atypical and unrepresentative actors. Prescriptions calling for a strengthening of the audit committee's role are deemed irrelevant in this context; mandatory changes tend to be superficially implemented and do not translate into a significant shift in committee members' ways of thinking and doing. However, our interviews point to one specific area where substantive change developed, that is to say committee members' views regarding the association between audit fees and audit quality. As such, our paper consolidates literature on trials of strength in bringing further light on their complexities - specifically in showing that trials can be tentacular (being loosely related to one another), paradoxical (generating resistance and compliance simultaneously), and secretive (taking place behind closed doors).

His work ranges from the application of traditional organizational theories within work organizations to poststructural renderings of capital market exigencies. Here, we consider and extend Professor Macintosh's work contemplating the morality embedded within, and propagated by, management accounting and control systems (macs). We begin with Macintosh (1995) employing structuration theory in investigating the ethics of profit manipulation within large, decentralized corporations. The work highlights the fundamental dialectical contradictions within these work organizations, demonstrates the indeterminacy of traditional ethical reasoning, and shows the extent to which macs provide legitimating underpinnings for management action. We propose to extend the conversation using the tools provided in Macintosh's subsequent work: a Levinasian ethic (Macintosh et al., 2009), and heteroglossic accounting (Macintosh, 2002)-both emerging from his poststructuralist predilections. A Levinasian perspective provides an ontologically grounded ethic, and heteroglossic accounting calls for multiple accountings representing alternative moral voices. A critical dialogic framework is proposed as a theoretic for imagining heteroglossic accounting that takes pluralism seriously by recognizing the reality of irresolvable differences and asymmetric power relationships associated with assorted moral perspectives. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Agonistic pluralism; Ethics; Heteroglossic accounting; Levinas; Structuration theory",,"Dillard, J.; School of Business Administration, , Portland, OR 97201, United States; email: jdillard@pdx.edu",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

As the gateway to the annual report, the paratext provides some of its most critical features, from whose subtle signs may be gained rapid, key and lasting impressions, forming implicit contracts between sender(s) and addressee(s). A study of the paratext assists in unpacking all those most visible, yet equally invisible, narrative and visual elements of the annual report that the reader takes for granted: its physical format, names, authorship, titles, epigraphs, prefaces (introduction/Chairman's Statement) and intertitles. It shows that these frame the reception of the text, add comment on intangibles, and form a zone of connection between the organization, culture and society. © 2010.",,,"Davison, J.; School of Management, , Egham, Surrey TW20 OEX, United Kingdom; email: jane.davison@rhul.ac.uk",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

This study examines the use of relative performance evaluation (RPE) as a form of compensation and control, including its historical emergence, using a genealogical history that attempts to provide some critique of its current day usage. In doing so, it follows the call by Norman Macintosh to both examine the social embeddedness of accounting, and to engage in reflexive accounting histories. The study argues that continued focus on relative results may pose challenges to incorporating ESG factors, and that further study of the RPE technique is needed, particularly with the increased focus on ESG at the policy level. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","ESG investing; Genealogy; Investment management industry; Pension funds; Relative performance evaluation",,"Himick, D.; Concordia University, 1455 de Maisonneuve Blvd., West Montreal, QC, Canada; email: dghimick@ucalgary.ca",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The research of Norman Macintosh demonstrated the potential of structuration theory as a sensitizing device for management accounting research by illustrating how accounting represents the dimensions of signification, legitimation and domination as well as the ethics of profit manipulation using the dialectic of control. He also demonstrated the role of agency in changing management accounting systems (MAS), which represent a source of ontological security, as well as the role of methodological bracketing. Extending the critical perspective of the work of Norman Macintosh, the investigation of accounting and the EU ETS using structuration theory demonstrated how the EU ETS and the financial reporting interpretation for emission rights, IFRIC 3, represented the dimensions of signification, legitimation and domination. A structural contradiction resulting in measurement mismatches, tension between two moral stances and resource allocation problems led to the withdrawal of IFRIC 3, which has resulted in the IASB and the FASB forming a coalition to develop guidance on accounting for ETS. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Emissions trading; Management accounting systems; Methodological bracketing; Norman Macintosh; Structural contradiction; Structuration theory; Unintended consequences",,"Moore, D.R.J.; School of Accounting, Australia; email: Davidr.Moore@vu.edu.au",,,10452354,,,,"English","Crit.

The diverse structures and media vehicles which she utilised to disseminate competing discourses are examined.

The injustices suffered by women clients provided case data which a critical practitioner such as Ethel Ayres Purdie could use to dispute official narratives.
